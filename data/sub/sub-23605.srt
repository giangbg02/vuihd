♫ <i>Don't get discourged</i> ♫

5
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,150
If a kid like that is our band's vocal...

is from our school.

<i>Episode 2</i> 
For the first time in history of our TV station,

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,280
<i>we attempted an interview with a vampire.</i>

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,930
Living in our society

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,620
<i>we were able to listen to a very shocking story.</i>

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:17,150
<i>Viewers, please listen to this interview to the end.</i>

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,450
Living in our society

20
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,390
but, there identities are not exactly revealed

21
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,300
Vampire interview?

22
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,330
<i>... it will be revealed for the very first time.</i>

23
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,080
Is this Han Shi Hoo?

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,310
Han Shi Hoo.

25
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,440
I suppose that is my new name this time?

26
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,810
That's right.

27
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,000
Vampire clan's media and interviews and all

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,510
activities that may cause a havoc socially are managed by us

29
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,270
Punishments for under age activities were decided

30
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,740
but, just in case documents for new name and ID are prepared.

31
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,000
I am not going to school anymore.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,560
VCS is notifying your new name Han ShiWoo and transfer school

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,940
I am done with school

34
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,260
Until VCS' decision has been implemented, your SPA will be discontinued.

35
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,420
Where's that kind of thing?!

36
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,230
We invite you to participate.

37
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,550
Humans are so cool.

38
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,390
one day, your next door neighbor is a vampire.

39
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,490
<i> If you find out, what are you going to do?</i>

40
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,560
Every time that happens, vampires have to run away.

41
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,530
<i> Look at what we are.</i>

42
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,360
<i> Do you see this?</i>

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,400
This is bad news. 
<i>Vampires are superior to humans. </i>

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,890
We gave up our abilities.

45
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,000
What do humans mean when they say "coexist"?

46
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,050
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

47
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,110
<i> Why do I keep thinking about a person's blood?</i>

48
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,130
<i> I think I'm becoming</i>

49
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,880
<i> more and more of a monster.</i>

50
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,840
Ah!

51
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,810
<i> I heard you were almost a legend. That you were the best in your middle school band.</i>

52
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,290
<i> Did you practice that in just one day?</i>

53
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,110
<i>- Yeah. 
- Wow~</i>

54
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,370
<i>My son is so great.</i>

55
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,380
<i>What about you?</i>

56
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,360
<i>Mom...</i>

57
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,620
<i>I'm happiest when I hear my Jae Min playing the guitar.</i>

58
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,960
<i>Can you play for me one more time?</i>

59
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,490
<i>Okay.</i>

60
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,250
<i>If that kind of girl is our band's vocal...</i>

61
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,420
<i>What to do?</i>

62
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,360
<i>Why is he like that?</i>

63
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,570
<i>Look</i>

64
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,960
<i> See what we really are.</i>

65
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,500
<i>- I don't like this sound.</i> 
- This is no joke. Ahh!

66
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,060
<i> Oh my gosh! Wow! </i>

67
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,770
<i>- Ah! 
- Why?</i>

68
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,120
<i> This is really no joke.</i>

69
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,980
<i>Vampires are superior to humans.</i>

70
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,510
<i>We gave up our abilities.</i>

71
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,200
What's wrong?

72
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,230
Why can't I replay it? 
- It's not broken...

73
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,530
<i>Why!</i>

74
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,620
<i>Something about a girl?</i>

75
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,570
<i>Who is it? Is she pretty? Is she?</i>

76
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,070
THE BAND Practice Room 
<i>Hey! Hyung, is she pretty? Why won't you answer?</i>

77
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,700
<i>- Is she pretty!?</i> 
<i>- It's none of my business.</i>

78
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:27,210
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Vampire Lovers @ Viki </i>

79
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,490
Nice catch.

80
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,880
You said you don't know how to play the guitar.

81
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,290
What is it?

82
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,830
You... Did you remember? What you need to apologize for?

83
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,930
Give it.

84
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,810
Thankfully it seems you remember me now.

85
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,310
But in turn, did you say you would run away if you saw me?

86
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,330
I said to give it.

87
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,110
I'm...

88
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,630
like dust. Do you want to blow me away?

89
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,510
What?

90
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,990
You haven't answered any of my questions.

91
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,990
This is outright treating a person like dust--

92
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,910
It's not like that.

93
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,210
Do you want to join a band?

94
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,570
I hear they're making a school band.

95
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,550
You like music and you're good at it.

96
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,190
If you do it,

97
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,150
I'm thinking of doing it, too.

98
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,890
I'm not doing that kind of thing.

99
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,430
What did I ever do?

100
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,030
Why does she always run away when she sees me?

101
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:24,710
Baek Ma Ri. Do you know you're really strange?

102
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:33,210

103

♫ <i>You</i> ♫

104
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:46,430

105

♫ <i>I'm afraid of you,</i> ♫

107
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,630
Don't you want to join the band club? 
I hear they're forming a school band.

108
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:05,230
Band club... sounds fun.

109
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,790
<i>I'm doing it. Just once.</i>

110
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,990
<i>Yeah, this school break try the literature program.</i>

111
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,690
<i>Just once.</i>

112
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,590
<i>In turn, I have a condition.</i>

113
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,950
<i>I have a voice I want to match with my guitar.</i>

<i>Vampire Control System</i>

116
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,150
Yes?

117

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Vampire Lovers @ Viki </i>

118
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,290
Are you okay?

119
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,930
Why is your body so cold?

120
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,650
You haven't eaten yet.

121
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,710
Wounds that come from the light don't heal well.

122
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,190
Unless you follow the instructions given from the VCS (Vampire Control System),

123
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,030
living as a vampire in this society is difficult.

124
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,630
Stop teaching. Why do you always try to teach?

125

<i>SPA

How about breakfast?

130
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,250
I'm late!

131
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,210
That's why I told you to wake up five minutes earlier!

132
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,110
I'll be back!

133
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,330
- I'll be back! 
- Yes...

134
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,790
Honey!

135
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,590
- Why? 
- This!

136
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,170
Ma Ri!

137
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,230
Ma Ri!

138
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,910
- Dad! 
- Ma Ri, Ma Ri!

139
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,910
Ah, your lunch.

140
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,510
Ah, sorry, Dad.

141
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,350
My daughter... something troubling you lately?

142
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,750
Yesterday, you didn't eat dinner, and today at breakfast too..

143
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,690
It's nothing.

144
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,430
You'll be in big trouble if you don't drink blood in over 12 hours.

145
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,010
Just think about it as the first and second halves of the day and

146
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,210
eat even if you don't feel like it.

147
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,750
You're going to be late. Hurry and go.

148
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,110
You should go back, Dad.

149
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,830
Okay. Go now.

150
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,810
Getting the instruments was the hardest challenge for us. 
Tell your father that I said thank you.

151
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,410
Just tell him some nice words, please.

152
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,590
Yes, Teacher.

153
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,410
But Ah Ra...

154
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,790
Yes?

155
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,690
Are you by chance friends with Baek Ma Ri?

156
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,030
Ah, the new kid who transferred?

157
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:44,570
Yeah. If you're friends with her, can you persuade her to join?

158
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,030
I would like it if Baek Ma Ri were vocals in our band.

159
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:57,530
Jae Min, that rascal, said that he would join band on the condition that Ma Ri was vocals,

160
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,810
so if you're close with Ma Ri, please try to persuade her.

161
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,410
Ma Ri!

162
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,770
Help, help. Let's go quickly.

163
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,390
Be careful, careful, so it doesn't break.

164
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,150
Okay now. The competition place is in a 10 minute distance,

165
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,230
so we're going to arrive before lunch ends.

166
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,370
Get on!

167
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,950
Teacher!

168
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,470
- I...  
- What are you doing? Get on, quickly!

169
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,490
He said that he has to bring these over quickly.

170
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,450
You guys worked hard.

171
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,490
Should we go and eat? How about pizza?

172
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,510
- We like it! 
- Pizza, pizza, pizza...

173
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,120
Pizza, pizza, pizza!

174
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,610
Pizza, pizza! 
- Teacher...

175
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,100
Can't I get off from here and go to school?

176
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,620
What?

177
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,780
Why? Are you hurt somewhere? 
<i>- Ah, so irritating.</i>

178
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,730
<i>Let's go home. Hurry, hurry. I have to go home.</i>

179
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,310
<i>If I don't have blood...</i>

180
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,520
What's wrong?

181
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,780
Baek Ma Ri.

182
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,770
<i>This is... the scent of blood?</i>

183
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,280
<i>It's sweet.</i>
synced by riri13

184
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,150
<i>Blood... I can't hold it in now.</i>

185
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,800
<i>I want to bite and eat it!</i>

186
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,980
<i>No!</i>

187
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,130
Are you okay?

188
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,660
Go away.

189
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,350
What is he doing?

190
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,520
Hey! Where's the nurse room?

191
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,310
There, there.

192
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,380
That's daebak!

193
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,120
Hey! You'll get indigestion. Drink slowly.

194
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,380
If you get indigestion from drinking blood, there's no medicine for that.

195
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,680
- I didn't eat, starting from yesterday night. 
- Why?

196
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,620
We can't do things like dieting.

197
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:59,840
- Taking blood regularly every 12 hours is basic vampire knowl- 
- Hey!

198
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:08,930
Nobody is here. The school nurse said she will go eat lunch, and I closed the door right away.

199
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,000
Be careful.

200
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,780
You... What would you have done if I wasn't there?

201
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,560
You're thankful, right?

202
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,840
- Aren't you thankful that I recognized you right away, too? 
- Yeah.

203
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,320
But how did you know it was me?

204
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,330
We've shared blood before so it's a given.

205
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,500
We were in a relationship where we even shared blood from the same bowl.

206
00:24:53,260 --> 00:25:01,230
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Vampire Lovers @ Viki </i>

207
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,570
<i>I recognized her right at first glance. Transferring,</i>

208
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:13,640
<i> isn't so bad, now that I'm here, thanks to her.</i>

209
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,400
Your locker doesn't open?

210
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,190
So you couldn't change into your gym clothes because your locker wouldn't open.

211
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:26,280
That's pretty fresh for an excuse, but it smells.

212
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,230
It smells like a lie.

213
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,450
How shall we pass go about PE?

214
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,070
Um, Teacher! I don't think Ma Ri would have a reason to lie.

215
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,130
So that's why we should check. Vice president, you go and check.

216
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:45,200
- What's your password? 
- 4-0-3

217
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,580
- Go! 
- Yes.

218
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:19,950
Baek Ma Ri, the consequence of a lie are laps.

219
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:25,190
I'll give you time to meditate about honesty on the school grounds.

220
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,110
Change and run!

221
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,930
Hurry!

222
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,800
- How many laps do you have left? 
- Two laps.

223
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,080
- Aren't you going to class? 
- It ended.

224
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,410
But you're good at acting. You seem like a real human.

225
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,370
Be quiet!

226
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:08,320
- I'm giving my full effort to be normal. 
- Normal?

227
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,060
You're so senseless. 
Hey, people are thinking that you're abnormal.

228
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,930
- About what? 
- I think you've been picked (to be the outcast) by the kids.

229
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,370
That means it's hopeless to be normal.

230
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,770
Why do you think they pulled the locker prank?

231
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,960
You received a punishment because of something you didn't do,

232
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,160
And you're lying by acting as if you're being properly punished.

233
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,730
You're pretty cool. 
If Coach knew, he would go crazy.

234
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,300
The fact that Baek Ma Ri is a vampire who wouldn't even be fazed by running around the schoolyard a hundred times.

235
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,990
You!

236
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,580
I heard that the new transfer student carried Baek Ma Ri and took her to the school infirmary.

237
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,130
They said he was a black night (a man who solves difficult situation for a woman).

238
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:46,610
Han Shi Woo... doesn't his pose look like a model?

239
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,560
Bling bling!

240
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,870
Look at how long his legs are!

241
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,590
Go away. Because of you, all the kids are looking.

242
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,810
Jerks. Just because they can see.

243
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:02,450
I don't like being noticed. Go to the classroom quickly. 
- Look at your sweat!

244
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,240
Why are they like that? Are the transfer students openly having a "some" relationship?

245
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,590
Ma Ri fainted and went to the infirmary during lunch.

246
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,060
Do you think she's okay? 
- Look at her playing.

247
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,890
- She's perfectly fine. 
- It was all an act.

248
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,320
Anyways, it's sure that she's a liar.

249
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,600
You better faint again as we run. More naturally.

250
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,470
I told you to go.

251
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,980
You're so prepared. Even thinking about sweat.

252
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,540
Since it's gym. 
- Give me some too.

253
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,990
We're running together, and it's weird that I'm not sweating, either.

254
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,510
Just say you're the type that doesn't sweat.

255
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,430
Is he flirting on his first day?

256
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:59,040
He is good looking, he has everything.

257
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,530
What are you doing? 
- Stay still.

258
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:10,290
Is it done? Are you the only one sweating? I'm sweating too.

259
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,630
W-What's wrong?

260
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,210
Don't even try hitting on my Ah Ra.

261
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,290
Let's go together!

262
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,730
Ah Ra, are you okay?

263
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,610
What's wrong?

264
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:51,800
- I was a bit surprised. 
- Ah, that scared me! I thought it was blood!

265
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,600
Tomato juice?

266
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,080
What in the world?

267
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,070
Who is it? Who did this?

268
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:07,510
Baek Ma Ri, can you open your locker?

269
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,570
The locker that you couldn't open, but Ah Ra could?

270
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,930
That's an interesting locker.

271
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,390
Why my locker?

272
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,890
I saw you drinking tomato juice yesterday.

273
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,990
You must really like tomato juice.

274
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,890
What does that have anything to do with you?

275
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,990
It doesn't, but this is...

276
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,510
I don't think this is a coincidence.

277
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,810
What do you mean?

278
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:37,190
What it means is, if there's tomato juice coming out of your locker, by chance,

279
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:41,390
I'll tell you if these are similar or not, after I compare it.

280
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:50,210
No wonder. My presentment...

281
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,050
Don't talk nonsense. How could you without evidence -

282
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:57,330
That's why we should find out if there is any evidence now.

283
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,270
I think so too.

284
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:02,590
In our class, there's no one who would do this to Ah Ra.

285
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,370
Hey, honestly, you're annoyed, right?

286
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:09,830
Since your locker opened, and since Ah Ra took out your gym clothes,

287
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,330
were you that annoyed to give her a punishment like that?!

288
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,590
Stop it, Ae Kyung.

289
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,330
Now that I think about it, my thinking was short.

290
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:21,810
I should've just told the PE teacher that it wouldn't open.

291
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,250
Ah Ra, why you?

292
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,810
Just because she lied. 
- I didn't lie!

293
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,790
So, let's open your locker!

294
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,610
I saw you take out your gym clothes earlier.

295
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,910
Is it not opening now? Let's open it!

296
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,830
Don't be like this!

297
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,370
Don't be like this!

298
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,450
I told you to open it!

299
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,490
Ah! Don't do this!

300
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,370
Move! You're not moving?

301
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,150
Get out of the way!

302
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,850
<i> Don't do it! 
- I told you to get out of the way!</i>

303
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,170
<i> Aish!</i>

304
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,550
<i> I told you to get out of the way!</i>

305
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:08,210
<i> Hey, don't be like this!</i>

306
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,850
What are you doing, in the classroom?

307
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,510
What do you think this act is, in the classroom?

308
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,990
You...

309
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,670
Why are you treating her like this?

310
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,410
Open the locker? With what rights?

311
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,530
Are you going to inspect her belongings?

312
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,950
If she did nothing wrong, she can just open her locker!

313
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,230
Just because Ma Ri has tomato juice,

314
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,950
doesn't mean that she did this. Does that even make sense?

315
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,430
- You guys, let's not- 
- Today

316
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:47,510
other than meal time and PE, everyone was in the classroom.

317
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:53,130
Baek Ma Ri was in the infirmary at lunch, 
and since she was receiving a punishment at gym, she came the latest.

318
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:57,070
- Just when, with what time, did she- 
- Hey, Jung Jae Min

319
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:01,930
What's with the Sherlock act? Are you some sort of detective?

320
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,530
Anyways, it's not Baek Ma Ri.

321
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:13,190
Then, who is there in the classroom who would do this to Baek Ma Ri?

322
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,850
Here.

323
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,370
I like tomato juice too.

324
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,390
<i>What is it? 
- It's tomato juice. </i>

325
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,430
I also have grape juice.

326
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,050
<i> Really! 
What?</i>

327
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,230
Sorry.

328
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,330
But you

329
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,930
are pretty when you're shocked.

330
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:58,590
<i>So cool! 
Daebak!</i>

331

Han Shi Hoo!

332
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,530
Did you really do this?

333
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,910
Why?

334
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,810
I have interest in you.

335
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:23,070
Oh!

336
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,750

341

No.

Should I tell you a scary secret?

378

My mom married a vampire today.

379
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,310
Jae Min, you're joining band, right?

380
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:08,870
Let's do it! My dad said he'd get us the best instruments.

381
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:12,510
It has been a while since I've played. 
My hands are probably all stiff.

382
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,950
Aigoo, Jae Min.

383
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,990
When we're 12th graders, we can only study.

384
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,230
Then, we won't have any high school memories.

385
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,910
Is that so?

386
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,490
Of course. If you don't do high school band now, you can't do it later.

387
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,310
Think about it.

388
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:35,490
If not now, you can't do it. If the chance passes you, you can't do it. Forever.

389
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,170
Yeah. That's so...

390
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:48,150
forever. You're right.

391
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,730
If I don't do it now, I can't do it ever again.

392
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,030
Right?

I can't do it. If it's not now.

395

Ah Ra, I'm really sorry,

396
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,950
but I can't go to the performance today. There's an emergency.
