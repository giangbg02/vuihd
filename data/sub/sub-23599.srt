00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,320
Hello, you're one of the new hires
at KBS this year, right?

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,320
Yes.

7
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,500
- Why are you running?
- I think I'm late to the welcome ceremony.

8

Do you know where TS-1 is?

9
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,670
Follow me.

10

Yes?

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,020
I have a live broadcast today
so I'm going to be busy.

12
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,310
Yes. Oh no...

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,350
Oh my. I'm going to kill myself.

14
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,280
I'll call you back later.

15
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,510
My goodness, what do I do.

16
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,680
I mean, what kind of a...

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,330
parking job is this?
No manners.

18
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,290
Uh, oh. Oh no, what do I do.

19
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,990
Which team are you in?

20
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,760
Documentary 3 Days.
I'm following new employees today.

21
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,140
Did you by chance film what happened here?
The car door?

22
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,640
Yes...

23
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,610
The car owner's number must
be somewhere...

26
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,200
- As CEO of KBS...
- I swear...

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,840
I swear!

28

<i>[How do you feel now?]
- Even during training, it didn't feel real.</i>

29
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,850
But, after receiving this and this...

30
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,250
it all feels more real now.

31

<i>[What's your first month salary?]
- Am I allowed to say?</i>

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,870
Around 1,890,000 won was
deposited to my account.

33
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,200
I withdrew all of it in cash and
gave it to my mother.

34
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,360
She cried.

35
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,660
Actually, I was unemployed
for four years.

<i>[Why did you apply to the
Variety Department?]</i>

37
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,120
Um.

38
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,970
Are there reasons that can't be shared?

39
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,920
Oh. Not exactly...

40
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,130
The... the person I like

41
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,870
works in the Variety Department.
So...

42
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,460
She was my senior when I was in
college. We were in the same club.

43
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,630
Because I hoped to work
near her...

44
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,000
<i>If she became a reporter instead, then you
would've taken the reporter's exam?</i>

45

<i>If she became an accountant, then
an accounting exam?</i>

46

48
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,070
I'm Kim Tae Ho PD from the
Variety Department.

49
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,440
- The one that produced 'Infinity Challenge'?
- MBC. KBS.

50
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,480
- Why? I'm Kim Tae Ho.
[Kim Tae Ho, 45 years old. Variety Department CP]

51
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,410
I get it. I hear there's someone at
MBC with a similar name as mine?

52
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,200
I came before him.
I'm the original Kim Tae Ho.

53
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,790
- Okay.
- Oh.

54
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,380
I know he's pretty good too.

55
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,580
He has some talent too, I guess?

56
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,300
We have a busy schedule today.

57
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,320
We used to get rookies to just tour
the recording studio for a few days.

58
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,330
But, that's very ineffective.

59
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,520
Since the latest trend is creativity,
competition, and alike...

60
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,830
on the job training (OJT), which
used to be five days long

61
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,630
will be conducted in just one day by
being creative and more economical.

62
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,210
Yes, sir.

63
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,770
If you feel that this condensed
training doesn't

64
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,810
allow you to learn the frame or certain
details of the Variety Department...

65
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,430
you can purchase a good book from
the store later.

66
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,650
There's a book titled
'What is a Variety Department PD?'.

67
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,480
There are many books with similar titles,
but with sub par quality.

68
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,830
So don't get confused.

69
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,920
<i>[What is Variety Department PD? By Kim Tae Ho]
- Others urged me to write this book, so I did.</i>

70
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,920
It's not like I'm trying to sell
my books here.

71
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,970
I don't get that much royalty.
Seriously.

72
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,850
I'm just trying to do a greater good...

73
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,420
by recommending this book.

74
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,740
Oh, when I was preparing for the
written examination

75
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,380
I bought it thinking that Kim PD
from 'Infinity Challenge" wrote it.

76
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,750
I wasn't the only one.
There were many others.

77
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,540
I hear that many copies
were returned.

78
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,910
But because I wrote my name here...

79
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,310
I couldn't return...

80
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:29,700
Alright, where should we start?
Oh right. There.

81
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,420
'Happy Together'...
Yoo Jae Suk. 'Night Market'.

82
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,300
- Sound familiar?
- Yes.

83
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,030
Hey Kwang Soo...
Oh your show aired yesterday, right?

84
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,730
Here... is what you'll see every morning.
The ratings list.

85
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,940
To us, this is like a report card.

86
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,840
- Uh, don't please.
- Why?

87
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,120
You got seven. Seven?

88
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,920
It's a good rating.
It's not easy to get seven these days.

89
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,930
- With season finales and cable channels...
- Give it to me.

90
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,500
Okay, let's get going now.

91
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,390
Oh, 'Immortal Song'.

92
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,190
Jae Young. Jae Young!
Since it's a music show...

93
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,260
the producer listens to music
all day long.

94
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,670
Hey, you should take it easy.
You'll damage your ears at this rate.

95
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,080
Since this is the new hires' OJT...

96
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,840
unlike training, we're supposed to learn from
observing the workings of the department.

97
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,040
So I came with very high expectations.

98
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,800
The CP has been fervently teaching
us this and that...

99
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,470
But, occasionally,
I found myself confused.

100
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,950
'Should I take down notes to record
what he's saying, or not?'

101
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,440
Everyone, watch me carefully.

102
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,230
Writer Lee Mi Rim, this
week's gag concert tickets?

103
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,440
I don't have any.

104
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,000
You saw, right?

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,110
This is very important. Life in the Variety
Department can be summed up in tickets.

106
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,690
What do I mean by that?

107
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,780
From now, whenever you meet people,
all conversations

108
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,600
will eventually end with a request
for gag concert tickets.

109
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,590
It's good to say 'no' from
the beginning.

110
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,880
Why?

111
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,490
Because you won't get any.

112
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,320
She really doesn't give out any.

113

He pulled an all-nighter again, didn't he.

Will his body be able to survive?

118

Good for building relationships

But, most of all, this is where you can get all

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,300
Oh... your car got dented by someone's
car door? It happened to me once too.

154
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,050
Older women tend to do that often.
Opening car doors without thinking.

155
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,560
- My car didn't get dented. I did it.
- What?

156
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,510
I'm saying I did it! Because I opened
the car door without thinking!

157
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,200
But, that was really a small dent.

158
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,910
How much will it cost?

159
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,440
- What kind of car was it?
- An import.

160
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,100
Was it my car?

161
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,950
Gosh, an imported junk car?
No, not yours, but an actual imported car.

162
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,240
Really?

163
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,290
Anyways, contact them right away.

164
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,230
If you're unlucky, they might frame
it as a hit-and-run.

165
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,280
I mean why would you drive an
imported car in such a tiny country?

166
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,610
And a huge car at that!

167
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,950
Look at Europe.

168
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,290
Even though their standard of living is
higher than us, they all drive city cars.

169
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,560
That's being sensible, don't you think?

170
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,100
And that's why I drive a city car too.

171
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,240
Even the toll rates are halved.

<i>Music Bank's PD is in a bad mood
today. Jindo dog #3.</i>

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,140
<i>The situation is grave.</i>

176
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,730
Why is she all of a sudden
Jindo dog #3?

177
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,530
The producer dented another
car on her way to work.

178
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,600
She's upset since she'll probably
have to pay for it.

179
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,390
I wish that car was mine.

180
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,740
Then I could've said it's okay
and become her close friend.

181
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,240
What is Jindo dog No. 3?

182
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,790
Oh that. Since you're new,
you're probably clueless.

183
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,750
Jindo dog is the code word we use
to represent emergency situations.

184
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,250
If it's #3, then it's not too serious.

185
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,220
As long as I don't instigate anything
with the PD, no harm will be done.

186
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,010
When it's #2, even if you don't do
anything, you might get attacked.

187
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,080
What about #1?

188
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,480
You shouldn't be in Yeouido.
It's like wartime.

189
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,180
- Gosh.
- I see...

190
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,460
- Take notes.
- Oh, okay.

<i>Owner of the car 1538, I'm sorry.</i>

192

<i>This morning in the parking lot, I
made a small mistake and dented your car.</i>

193

charge of your OJT this afternoon.

The core member, the queen bee, and
the king sister of Variety Department.

195
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,500
I mean the goddess.

<i>Please give me a call.</i>

197
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,840
The goddess, PD Tak Ye Jin.

198
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,900
You, slacker, over there.

199
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,770
Don't you know that personnel in broadcasting
should all have their phones on vibrate?

200
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,190
If your phone rings during a live show,
then that's a broadcast accident.

201
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,400
- I'm sorry.
- And don't say 'I'm sorry' so easily.

202
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,650
We are PDs.

203
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,780
What I mean is that you shouldn't
grovel that easily.

<i>[Tak Ye Jin. 35 years old.

205
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,460
Well, yes, I tend to become more
sensitive before the live broadcasts.

206
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,250
And there was a small accident
in the morning.

207
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,280
Oh, I messaged the car owner!

208
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,090
But, it shows as unread.
Not reading the message.

209
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,250
I'm sure they will. Yeah.

210
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,800
It's a little weird.

211
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:53,500
This is camera 1, 2, 3, 4, and
over there is 5.

212
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,910
All connected like this completes
the screen.

213
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,690
It's important to make the calls
accurately.

214
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:04,580
The most frustrating ones are the ones who put
camera 2 on standby and call 'cut' on camera 3.

215
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,000
Then why bother putting camera 2
on standby, right?

216
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,990
And you know for some shows they
film from above.

217
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,450
- That camera is called a Jimmy Jib.
- Jimmy Jib.

218
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,120
Like camera 5 over there.

219
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,310
Who's that? There's a person.

220
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:26,290
Associate producers tend to sleep
in recording studios like that.

221
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,840
Doesn't look like sleeping.
Let's take a look...

222
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,310
Isn't she an associate producer for
'Entertainment Weekly'? Shin Hae Joo?

223
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,640
- Who's that next to her?
- It's Ra Joon Mo.

224
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,080
Why is Ra Joon Bal over there?

225
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,300
He said he's going to the Korean
Communications Commission (KCC).

226
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,150
There's a rumor that they're dating.
Is that true?

227
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,440
They must have something to talk about.

228
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,520
Just because a male and female talk, it
doesn't mean they're dating. How tacky.

229
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,190
Look at that. They're dating.

230
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,860
Ra Joon Mo has skills.
How many years apart are they?

231
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,100
How would I know that?

232
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,560
Can you please check the location
of the air shoot.

233
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,000
We can't have those flower petals
falling like last time.

No, I'm a new rookie in the

Oh right, school.

244
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,010
You lived by school in Shilim-dong.

Hello?

257
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,030
I said, let's have our meeting
at 4 p.m. today.

258
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,300
I'm going to the KCC.

259
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,560
I have the thing with the KCC...
The KCC!

260
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,120
Yeah. Okay, okay.

261
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,320
Yes.

262
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,890
To be specific, the KCC is the
Korean Communications Commission.

263
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,140
It's like... how do I put this?

264
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,070
If ratings are a PD's report card,
then the KCC is like the student profile.

265
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,040
If you get one of these things,
it means you did something wrong.

266
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,800
Wait, wait a minute now.
This is going to be aired, right?

267
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,480
I can't say the wrong thing now.
I'll do this part again, okay?

268
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,450
It is a very important institution.

269
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,290
TV is broadcasted to the general public.

270
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,960
Their role is to check for any violations
of the regulations.

271
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,210
As well as guide us to a wholesome
broadcast culture.

272
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,270
However, it is unpleasant to hear
from them.

273
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,750
Whether you're a child or an adult,
no one likes to be lectured.

274
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,410
No, this isn't quite right either...

275
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,310
The one that variety show PD's get
called on the most?

276
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,900
Damage to one's dignity.

277
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,300
But honestly,
we really don't have much dignity.

278
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,000
Either that or smoking.

279
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,690
This one is so hard to notice.

280
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,110
When people smoke behind a tree,
it really is so hard to see them.

281
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,530
Also, failing to wear a seat belt or
filming on top of a railway.

282
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,900
Or failing to wear a motorcycle helmet.

283
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,170
The thing is, all of that is okay
in movies.

284
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,960
You can be really cool. You know...

285
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,060
But, do that on TV and
you'll get a summons right away.

286
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,110
<i>[Why were you summoned today?]</i>

287
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,800
Oh today?

288
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,150
You uttered a vulgar word during
a broadcast. What was it?

289
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,220
It was 'booger'.

290
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,800
The word 'booger' appeared in a
total of 15 episodes.

291
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,810
It was even mentioned in reference
to eating it.

292
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,950
Ah, the thing is...

293
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,930
When eating was mentioned,
it was not about physically ingesting it.

294
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,450
It's an action representative of people
who are lacking and

295
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,660
taking into account that everyone
in this nation can agree...

296
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,660
Was it not possible to replace it with
a more dignified term?

297
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,270
It just wouldn't have been the same
with a word like 'secretion'...

298
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:47,190
There's something that feels orthodox
about the word 'booger'.

299
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,910
Anyway...

300
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,790
But, I do apologize.
I will rectify that.

301

To make it worse, it was during meal time,
your show 2 Days, 1 Night!

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:03,910
Do you think viewers would like
that while they're eating?

303
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,210
I don't think they'd like it very much.
I apologize.

304
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,540
It's good that you apologize
quickly, PD Ra Joon Mo.

305
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:16,360
But, you're always back in here again,
so as for your sincerity...

306
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,430
Gosh, all this over a booger.

307
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,780
Oh! Reporter Kang.

308
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,650
Oh? You're here again!

309
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,930
A PD should be at the station.
Why are you always here?

310
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,340
That's what I'm saying.

311
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,320
Stop writing negative pieces about
my show.

312
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,560
Well, once your show's gone,
I won't be able to write them.

313
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,950
What are you talking about?

314
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,240
I heard your show is getting canceled.

315
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,910
- Huh?
- It's not true?

316
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,740
If that were true, I'm the PD.
Wouldn't I know about it?

317
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,320
It's just common sense.

318
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,700
When a program is getting axed,
the producer seems to be the last to know.

319
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,920
What, seriously...
Where are you hearing these weird things?

320
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:14,920
Why wouldn't I know my own show? Huh?
I'm... I'm the PD! I am!

321
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,060
2 Days, 1 Night... Season 1.

322
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,250
When Young Suk and Myung Hwan were here,
things were really good back then.

323
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,180
Kang Ho Dong and Lee Seung Gi...

324
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,220
But, in Season 2 things were
a little shaky.

325
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,860
And then Season 3, Yoo Ho Jin
actually did pretty well.

326
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,030
After that, it was passed onto me.
It's all the same really.

327
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,900
A bunch of guys come out and
do this and that.

328
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,230
So, we completely changed everything.

329
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,160
A 2 Days 1 Night with female actresses.
It's innovative!

330
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,500
2 Days... 1 Night...

331
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,760
Can you try being more in unison
and say 2 Days and 1 Night loudly together?

332
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,730
2 Days... 1 Night!

333
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,360
Yes.

334
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,430
For our Spring Special,
we'll be going to Geojedo.

335
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,990
Where? Geojedo?
I can't go.

336
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,610
Let's just stay in Kyungki.
Why do you want to go so far?

337
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,240
I have a gastric ulcer.
Don't feed me stuff like fish extract.

338
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,720
If the toilet is an outhouse like
last time, I'm not going.

339
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,090
And sleeping outside? Do you want to
see me get joint pain and die? I can't.

340
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,230
Yeah.

341
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,650
We should go to some campgrounds
nearby and just shoot.

342
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,790
Just because you go far away,
you don't get ratings.

343
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,950
How can we go to Geojedo?

344
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,220
It's so cold right now.

345
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,010
Other programs seem to have
no problem making it fun without going.

346
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,990
But, the thing is...
It must've been too innovative.

347
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:53,740
The ratings are, well...
honestly they've hit rock bottom.

348
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,560
That's why there are false rumors
like this going around.

349
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,260
But, times of crisis are also
an opportunity.

350
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,100
I'm not that worried.

351
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,300
<i>[5:00 PM -
2 Days 1 Night Meeting Room]</i>

352
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,280
Can you please sit down?
You're giving me a headache.

353
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,710
Where's Writer Choi?

354
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,470
I just spoke to her.
She's crossing the Mapo bridge.

355
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,100
She'll be here soon.

356
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,420
Things sure are going well, huh?

357
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,020
There are all sorts of rumors flying
around and the main writer is missing.

358
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,590
What rumors?

359
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,260
What's the item for next week?
Do you have it?

360
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,520
Why don't we go to Jejudo?

361
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,720
Last season, where did we go
for our last episode?

362
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,210
Jejudo.

363
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,390
What about Mamma Mia?
That program that got canceled?

364
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,350
- Jejudo.
- That's right!

365
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,110
When a show is truly desperate,
they go to Jejudo.

366
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,800
When you start to think,
we need to go to Jejudo...

367
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,970
your show has come to
the end of its run.

368
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,040
But, last week Infinity Challenge went to
Jejudo and they had great ratings.

369
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,480
Are you stupid?
That show's run by Producer Kim Tae Ho.

370
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:20,000
Producer? What happened to Miss A
possibly appearing on our show this week?

371
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,940
There was that schedule conflict with
Music Bank you're trying to work out.

372
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,950
- It's not going to work, is it?
- It will!

373
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,860
If I call, it will work out.
Miss A.

374
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,300
If you run a big show like Music Bank,
you tend to get a lot of requests.

375
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,060
Requests from your work seniors,
the Department Chief...

376
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,020
No matter what, you've just got to
reject them all and move on.

377
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,470
If you do everything they ask,
the requests will never end.

378
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:51,310
Even if the President comes and asks,
you need to know how to say 'No'.

379
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,870
I'll be here longer than the President
anyways, right?

380
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,370
Of course, I'm sure you all will be here
longer than I will.

381
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,430
<i>- What?
- I need to ask a favor.</i>

382
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,460
A favor?

383
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,780
Oh, hold on.

384
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,050
<i>[Joon Bal]</i>

385
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,710
So, what favor do you need from me
Ra Joon Mo PD?

386
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,170
I need Miss A on my show next week,
but because of Music Bank...

387
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,210
- Can you do a prerecording for them?
- No.

388
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,890
I have many singers going on that day.

389
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,270
Gosh, PD of Music Bank...
just do me this favor.

390
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,040
If I take out Miss A, I have to adjust
the entire line-up.

391
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,270
Please don't latch onto me to solve your
issues and take care of it on your own.

392
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,360
So, keep this in mind.

393
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,540
In this industry, you have to have
your own back.

394
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:04,650
If you're out there helping others,
in the end you'll be left with nothing.

395
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,490
Take care of yourself.
Okay?

396
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,260
Okay, should we slowly head up now?

397
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,690
Oh my...

398
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:18,840
Wait... just wait.
Let's go in a little bit.

399
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,160
Latch onto her?

400
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,000
Who is she saying I'm latching onto?
She has no clue what's going on.

401
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,550
Is it going to happen or not?

402
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,110
I need to know if I have to
find materials or not.

403
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:36,020
Just hold on a second!
She shouldn't be this way to me!

404
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,180
Gosh, seriously!

405
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,790
Hey, PD Ra... the Department Chief is
looking for you.

406
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,650
What is it?
You must know something.

407
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,660
What would I know?

408
00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:00,010
I met Reporter Kang at the KCC.
He was saying some strange things.

409
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:03,010
How did that go, by the way?

410
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:08,850
Even that, other CP's go to the KCC
on behalf of the PD's and support them.

411
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,620
Did I really have to go there?

412
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:15,480
You look good in a suit.
And I only have suits for funerals.

413
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,200
- So, you really don't know anything?
- What would I know?

414
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,610
How many times have you been to
the KCC this month now?

415
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,880
What is it this time? A warning?

416
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:37,390
Still, because I go so often,
there are people who are friendly to me.

417
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:42,010
There are people who say,
it is very regrettable.

418
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,760
I don't think they will slap us with
a warning this time.

419
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,920
You must be proud.

420
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,710
It really is strange.

421
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:55,490
How could all the age groups not be
watching your show?

422
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,320
Chief, if you look here... right here...

423
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,300
there are portions with sudden rises.

424
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,290
People have caught wind of it.

425
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:08,240
I don't know about wind or whatever,
but it's definitely game over, Joon Mo.

426
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,850
Tae Ho.

427
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,060
Honestly, is 5.7 acceptable for a
Sunday variety show?

428
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,490
Back in the day, when I did Super Sunday
with Lim Baek Chun...

429
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,460
the ratings went up to 35.

430
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,710
Our theme song back then was,
the Pet Shop Boy's, Go West.

431
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,010
- It was such a good song.
- It really was.

432
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:34,050
Chief, these days there are so many
mediums. Today's 5.7 is like a 15.

433
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:38,720
That's just the excuse people with 5.7
ratings make.

434
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,970
There's just no answer.
Let's just pull the plug.

435
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,490
What?

436
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,120
- Chief!
- It's already been decided.

437
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,690
- Tae Ho, did you know?
- You didn't know?

438
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,150
The entire variety department knew.

439
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,280
The lady who sells spicy rice cakes in
front of the station knew. Why didn't you?

440
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,020
Tae Ho!

441
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,190
Chief...

442
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,390
You, yourself, okayed the idea to have
the older ladies on the variety show.

443
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,400
Yeah I did, so you
should've done a good job.

444
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,640
One year ago, what did you say when
you started this program?

445
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:19,550
You said if Na Young Seok hit a triple,
then you'd hit a home run.

446
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,200
This isn't a home run.
It's a double play.

447
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,620
Oh... I really didn't know about this.

448
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,530
The game was over,
but here I was by myself...

449
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:34,400
Like a fool, bunting and stealing bases
all day and night.

450
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,050
Pull the plug?

451
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:41,590
What do you mean, pull the plug?
I can't do that!

452
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,170
- Didn't you tell him in advance?
- Of course I did.

453
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,650
He just doesn't seem to get it.

454
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,940
He only has old ladies as guests.

455
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,360
He spends all that money and has on
ratings this low. He has no conscience.

456
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,150
Don't you think so?

457
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,540
What if he goes to the union or
something?

458
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,760
What could he possibly say to them?

459
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,770
This isn't a political program with
controversial topics.

460
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,150
We're pulling the plug because it's
unpopular.

461
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,110
Now that I think about it,
Na Young Seok was really good.

462
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,600
Isn't there any way we could bring
him back?

463
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,270
We're going to go to Jejudo.

464
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,040
- We can't do Jejudo.
- How about Ieodo?

465
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,960
Well, I feel like...

466
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,730
a head of family with elementary,
junior high, and high school student kids

467
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,840
that has suddenly become unemployed.

468
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,550
How am I supposed to take care of them?
How am I supposed to feed them?

469
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,960
I'm blood type A.

470
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,880
That means I'm already very responsible.
This is becoming more important.

471
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,090
What about me?

472
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,760
What happens to me?

473
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,970
You would've talked about what
happens to the PD. Am I gone too?

474
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,310
You have to tell me that
so I can make plans.

475
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,200
You're not going anywhere.

476
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,320
I'm just saying, pick out some new
members and go at it again.

477
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,410
Starting when?

478
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,440
What do you mean when?
Immediately.

479
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,610
Huh?

480
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,010
Look here. Next week, there will be
soccer programming.

481
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:02,090
The following week, they can play
the highlights. You have two weeks.

482
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,560
I can't do it in two weeks.

483
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,110
Then, should I look at another team
that's been preparing a variety program?

484
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,030
Considering external teams,
we have several.

485
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,430
I'll get it done.

486
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:16,530
Okay. The most urgent thing now is
letting the team members know.

487
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,100
Chief.

488
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,430
Tomorrow, we're having a one year
anniversary dinner with everyone there.

489
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,570
How can I say that at a
place like that?

490
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,450
Oh yeah?
Well, things got simple then.

491
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:32,810
- What?
- You can tell them and do a goodbye party.

492
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,940
Then, you can save the cost of a
goodbye party.

493
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,220
When things start to work out,
they really do.

494
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,200
Where are you all meeting?

495
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,110
At Bi Bong, in front of the station.

496
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:47,520
If it's the dinner course,
it's quite expensive per person.

497
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,410
But, it's not bad for the price.

498
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:56,720
The Mae Course comes with pine nut
porridge. It's delicious.

499
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,750
Yes, it is. But, will
everyone have the Mae Course?

500
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,220
It wouldn't just be one or two people.

501
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,600
Should we order the Ran Course?
That one is about 30,000 per person.

502
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,350
There's no porridge in the Ran Course.

503
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:14,940
- You can add it on the side.
- Even the pine nut porridge?

504
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,500
Yes, even the pine nuts.

505
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:22,470
Then, we'll do the Ran course meal
with pine nut porridge.

506
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:27,230
So, wait...
We're not filming the last episode?

507
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,270
All you think about is spending money.
Don't you think about the company?

508
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,240
Okay.

509
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,460
Then during the dinner tomorrow

510
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,320
you're going to announce it to
everyone right, Chief?

511
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,880
I told you. You have to announce it
before the dinner.

512
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,770
Do you want to have pine nut porridge
bowls being thrown around?

513
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,930
When a new program starts,
it's like a baby's first birthday.

514
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:04,470
Everyone comes out to give you blessings.
And you just smile for no reason.

515
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,060
When a program is coming to an end,
it's like a funeral.

516
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:14,120
Especially when it's a lowly rated program,
nobody shows up.

517
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,900
There are no visitors and no money.

518
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,130
It's very lonely.

519
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,950
I think this line was pretty good.

520
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,040
Don't edit it out.
It was a really good figure of speech.

521
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,420
What was the important thing you
had to talk to me about?

522
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,870
Oh, it's nothing really.
It's not that important.

523
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:51,070
Is Cindy on Music Bank today?

524
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,700
Yes, she's up for the number one spot.

525
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,500
My second daughter is a fan of hers.

526
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,620
And she just happens to be in Yeouido.

527
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,320
She's riding her bike with her friends.

528
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,100
Oh.

529
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,120
<i>[5:30 PM - One hour before going live]
[Music Bank Dressing Room]</i>

530
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,680
<i>[Cindy, 23 Years Old]
[Debuted 10 Years Ago]</i>

531
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:22,580
Is the light working okay?
Isn't is kind of dark in here?

532
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:27,320
It's fine, but what are you doing
all the way here?

533
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,740
Oh, I was just wondering if Cindy
was comfortable with everything.

534
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,250
How's the chair?
It looks uncomfortable.

535
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,010
This chair's been here since I first
started working here in 1997.

536
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,590
It's time for a change, huh?

537
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,870
Oh no, it's really fine.

538
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:49,020
Um, it's really time for her to go
on live soon.

539
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,680
Oh yes, that's right!
Then, do a good job.

540
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,820
But, how are you for time?

541
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,880
I'm wondering if you could go and
say hello to the Chief.

542
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,920
That's nice of you to suggest,
but the time... and it's a live show...

543
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,580
Oh, is that so?
But, it'll just take five minutes.

544
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,170
Maybe it's too much.

545
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,720
She is in full make up and
her shoes are uncomfortable.

546
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,350
That's true. It would be too much to
go all the way there, right?

547
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,580
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. There's nothing you can do.

548
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,260
Then how's this?

549
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:44,440
It's too much to go,
so how about some pictures?

550
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,690
Huh?

551
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,870
Come in, over here.

552
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:52,220
This here is the Department Chief's
daughter, Jang Yae Rim.

553
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,910
Here, say hello and come
stand next to Cindy.

554
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,110
Hi, I'm a big fan. Take a picture.

555
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,900
One, two, three... just one more.

556
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,330
One, two, three... two, three.

557
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,380
One more.

558
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,620
What is this? She's so rude.

559
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,710
Hey, hey. Look at her expression.
Wow, amazing.

560
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,200
Would it kill her to take a picture?
Would her face wear down?

561
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,490
She's rude just like people said.

562
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:32,190
- What kind of attitude is this to fans?
- Really, how annoying.

563
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,630
Whose dressing room do you want
to visit next?

564
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,710
- EXO?
- Yes please! Yes!

565
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,150
This is why I said I didn't want
to do rehearsals.

566
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:49,120
Because I'm sitting in here,
all sorts of weird things happen.

567
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,950
Ask them to let me off for the
next dress rehearsal.

568
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,430
But, the main PD is extremely difficult.

569
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,450
And in your eyes...

570
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,920
am I not difficult?

571
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,220
Oh no, I do think you're
extremely difficult.

572
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,000
Have I wronged you in some way?

573
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,010
What?

574
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,470
That's not what I meant.

575
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:27,440
Well now, just be honest and
speak your mind.

576
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,280
What was I so extremely
difficult about?

577
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,310
- That's not what I meant.
- What do you mean, it's not...

578
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,670
I'm sorry.

579
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,370
What is it you're sorry for?

580
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:50,020
I'm asking because I'm truly curious.
What are you sorry about?

581
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,800
Cindy?

582
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,860
I think you're going to
have to change.

583
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,140
See-through isn't allowed.

584
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,250
<i>Mr. Car-owner,
you must be very busy.</i>

585
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,650
<i>I didn't receive an answer,
so I'm texting you again.</i>

586
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:12,320
<i>Once you see this,
please contact me.</i>

587
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,420
<i>Have a lovely day.</i>

588
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,450
Why isn't he reading it?
I'm sure this is the right number.

589
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,000
- Turn it off.
- I'm sorry.

590
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,200
Kids these days.

591
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,670
Hey, just because I use my phone,
do you think you can too?

592
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,890
<i>The customer has turned off the phone.
You will be connected to voicemail.</i>

593
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,670
Wow, he just completely
turned off his phone now.

594
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,880
This guy is no joke.

595
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,750
Ye Jin, about the outfit you
asked Cindy to change into...

596
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,760
Yeah, see-through is not allowed.
Why?

597
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,510
- She says she won't change into it.
- What?

598
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,870
Why?

599
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:25,140
She says it's the
concept for her new album.

600
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:29,670
Tell her manager to come in. No in fact,
tell her manager's boss to come in.

601
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,130
Okay.

602
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,370
Why can't she change her outfit?

603
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:39,930
It's our first comeback week and
it's the concept for her new album.

604
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:44,530
- If you can just...
- I told you it's too racy for KBS.

605
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,190
Why do I have to keep
repeating myself?

606
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:52,290
I understand, I'll see if I can
persuade her. Give me a moment.

607
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:00,590
You can get things done
more efficiently

608
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:06,250
by communicating with the manager
instead of talking to the celebrity directly.

609
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,060
They're probably shocked since the
producer is personally getting involved.

610
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,150
Producer, you'll just have to
let Cindy wear it. I'm sorry.

611
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,740
- Look...
- Hello?

612
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,960
Hello, Producer!

613
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:41,400
This won't do. I'm going
to have to talk her personally.

614
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,800
Producer Ye Jin!
Are you going to fight with her?

615
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:50,930
Fight? With who?
Me and Cindy?

616
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,670
How can I fight with her?
It's more like a scolding.

617
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,070
Holy cow!

618
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,200
- Manager.
- Yeah?

619
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,510
Can you step outside for a moment?

620
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:23,850
The sound of your
breathing is a bit loud.

621
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:30,190
Oh, sorry for breathing so loud.

622
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,340
Producer Ye Jin.

623
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,770
Ms. Cindy, I'm Tak Ye Jin.
The producer of Music Bank.

624
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:54,410
I clearly told you earlier that I
wanted you to change your outfit.

625
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,170
I guess that's too
difficult for you to do.

626
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:02,440
You must not have gotten the message.
I said I won't change my outfit.

627
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:08,350
The problem is not the message.
The problem is you're not allowed.

628
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:12,520
Racy outfits are not allowed
according to KBS policy.

629
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:17,290
This outfit is pretty, not racy.

630
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:23,720
Excuse me, the guy with the
tear drop patterned necktie.

631
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:29,080
Don't you agree?

632
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:36,690
- Don't you think this is pretty?
- Yes, it's pretty.

633
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:43,280
See?
He says it's pretty, Producer.

634
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,510
Men like it.

635
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:53,250
Women like you... who are slightly
old may not see it that way.

636
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,570
Even older women watch
Music Bank with their sons.

637
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:02,970
They watch Music Bank
with their sons?

638
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:09,430
Have you ever watched Music Bank
with your mother at home?

639
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,700
I don't recall...

640
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,390
but I think I have, though.

641
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,750
I think it's the respectful
thing to do when the head producer

642
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,910
personally asks you
to change your outfit.

643
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:32,060
Is it necessary for you to give
everyone a hard time like this?

644
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,660
Okay.

645
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:43,910
- Good. You understand now?
- Yes. I won't do this program.

646
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:47,850
What?

647
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:53,500
It seems I'm a nuisance to
this program.

648
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:59,780
I'll just leave.
Manager, let's go.

649
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,430
- That's not what I meant!
- Then what did you mean?

650
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,980
Seriously, this won't do.

651
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,000
Everyone, get out.

652
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:16,570
- Producer Ye Jin...
- Get out!

653
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,460
Sure.

654
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:33,490
Cindy... you really don't know
what the main problem is right now?

655
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:40,010
What is it?

656
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:44,070
It's KBS. The fact that it's a
live broadcast is the problem.

657
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:49,200
I think this outfit is so pretty,
but the station won't allow it!

658
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,240
I am truly upset!

659
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,240
So... how do you know that
when I haven't been on stage?

660
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,320
It's without a doubt 100 percent!
I guarantee it!

661
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,950
If you perform on stage
with this outfit right now...

662
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:07,980
- I'll have to answer to the board.
- So what the heck am I supposed to do?

663
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,930
I'm not asking you to do anything
out of the ordinary, so basically...

664
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:17,100
That outfit you have on is nice, but how
about you wear a jacket with it? Huh?

665
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:22,530
Showing a little skin instead of showing
everything is considered sexy. Huh?

666
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,800
Producer.

667
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:29,510
- That is see-through.
- You're right!

668
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:34,340
That is see-through, but let's
cover it up just a tad bit more.

669
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,930
Don't you think it'll
be so much sexier? Huh?

670
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,480
Is there even a jacket for me to wear?

671
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,850
Oh my gosh, are you going to wear it?
You're going to wear a jacket for me?

672
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,240
Seriously, I'm so honored.

673
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:55,870
Now I know why you're
all the rage these days.

674
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,910
You're such an understanding person.

675
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,190
Thank you.

676
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:07,510
Bring her a jacket. She said
she'll record with extra top on.

677
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,150
Did you scold her a lot?

678
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,980
Don't go around spreading rumors
that Cindy got scolded by me.

679
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,020
She's not at a level to be
scolded by producers anymore.

680
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,220
Hey, slacker boy.

681
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,180
- Me?
- Yes, you.

682
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,140
What's your name?

683
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,260
It's Baek Seung Chan.

684
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:35,460
Okay, Baek Seung Chan.
You must feel very sad right now.

685
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,560
Did Cindy look that pretty
in her see-through outfit?

686
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,220
Are you one of her groupies?
Are you stupid?

687
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:44,010
- I'm sorry.
- I told you not to say 'I'm sorry!'

688
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:47,600
I'm in a battlefield right now
trying to win a war!

689
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,440
And you're in a dugout eating cookies!

690
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,780
What a nice way to go.

691
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,950
If you have a mouth,
then go ahead and say something!

692
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,530
If I try to apologize
whenever you reprimand me...

693
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,430
I'm sorry.

694
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,070
I told you not to say 'I'm sorry.'

695
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,320
You tell me not to say 'I'm sorry.'

696
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,210
If I stay still,
you ask me why I'm so quiet.

697
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,850
If you have a mouth,
then go ahead and say something!

698
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,560
And you ask me if I have a mouth.

699
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:16,790
So I apologize once again.

700
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,020
However, I can't say I'm sorry.

701
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:27,230
The only thing left is to
shake hands.

702
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,290
<i>[6:20 p.m. just minutes before
Music Bank is about to go live.]</i>

703
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:35,870
The '2 Days, 1 Night' team said they
were going to give us the final copy.

704
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:37,360
Why haven't we heard from them?

705
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,290
They're under fire right now.

706
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:43,250
I saw Joon Mo go to the Chief's office
earlier, and I think he got an earful.

707
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,640
And I heard he went to see
the board in the afternoon.

708
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,920
Okay, bring it over
whenever it's finalized.

709
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,290
Attention, rookies.

710
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,100
As you probably know...

711
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:02,030
there are many instances where other
programs ask Music Bank for casting favors.

712
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:07,360
We're pretty much the powerhouse
over the whole variety sector.

713
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:15,150
At times like this, helping each other
out is a win-win situation.

714
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:20,560
Granted, you don't agree right away,
but only when the timing is right.

715
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,270
Okay? Watch.

716
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,630

00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,090
<i>What?</i>

718
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:32,400
It's about the favor you asked earlier.
About 'Miss A' for next week.

719
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,450
I'll pre-record it for you.

720
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:36,500
<i>Forget it. I don't need it.</i>

721
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:41,300
Hello? I didn't hear you.

722
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:46,200
The reception here isn't very good,
so the calls get dropped frequently.

723
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:55,530
<i>[7 p.m. Music Bank Live Broadcast.]</i>

724
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,320
She wore the jacket!

725
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,280
Let's use camera four for the first cut.

726
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:10,710
Zoom out on Cindy's face.
Music standby. Okay... cue.

727
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:20,990
One, cut!

728
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,150
<i>Two, cut!</i>

00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:31,670
Wow!

730
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,780
It wasn't... it wasn't me...

731
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,440
Four cut.
One cut.

732
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,820
Two cut.

Four cut.

739
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:07,780
- Good job, everyone.
- Good job today.

740
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:11,160
Tell Cindy's manager I
want to see him immediately.

741
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,530
There's another event, so they
left as soon as Cindy was done.

742
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,780
- Already?
- Yes.

743
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:24,670
Wow, they ran away because
they're so scared of me.

744
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,900
Right? That's what it is, right?
Oh my gosh.

745
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:33,940
- Tell her CEO to stop by tomorrow.
- CEO Byun?

746
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,470
He's not the type to come
because you tell him to...

747
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:40,270
Of course he should come.
Why wouldn't he?

748
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,570
You.

749
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:53,880
You must've been ecstatic to see
Cindy with her pretty clothes on.

750
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,070
Your reaction was pretty strong back there.
Are you part of the audience?

751
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:07,090
Sure! Hey... why don't you
be a part of the audience?

752
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,970
You said Cindy's outfit
was pretty earlier.

753
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:12,190
Go and and tell her exactly
what I said.

754
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:14,990
That it was very pretty and
it wasn't even remotely racy!

755
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,000
<i>It's your first day on the job.
How was it today?</i>

756
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:44,560
How do you think it was today?

757
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,670
<i>Joon Mo, where are you?</i>

758
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:00,440
I have a gathering today
with my team members.

759
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,210
No, I'm going to be late today.

760
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,070
No, I'm going to be more late
than that.

761
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,930
Yeah, I think I'm going to be tired.

762
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,960
Okay, bye.

763
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:19,640
- Producer, hello.
- Hey.

764
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,100
- Hey.
- Yes?

765
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,330
Are you still working for CEO Byun?

766
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,870
- Yes.
- Who are you managing now?

767
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:31,700
- Cindy.
- Really?

768
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,970
Yes.

769
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,910
Is that dinner?

770
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:50,950
I already ate earlier.
This is for Cindy.

771
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:53,590
We have to get to Suwon by
ten and we're short on time.

772
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,760
Put that down.

773
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,810
What's taking him so long?

774
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,540
Where is he going?

775
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:20,830
Ma'am, I'd like a maechu kimbap, beef
kimbap, and a fish cake soup to go.

776
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:23,630
- Okay.
- Producer...

777
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,970
You... go and relay
this message to CEO Byun.

778
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:33,300
Tell her to at least feed her kids
if she's going to work them to death.

779
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:39,080
She should at least feed her if
she's going to work her like a slave!

780
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,990
Tell her to dance and sing all day!

781
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:47,430
I swear, that life-sucking leech!
That Byun-pire!

782
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,400
Are you kidding me?

783
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,710
Don't you know that I
don't eat carbohydrates?

784
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,300
Plus...

785
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,430
are you telling me to
eat this salty soup?

786
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:07,520
Do you want me to dance
with a swollen face?

787
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,120
What was I supposed to do? The producer
insisted that I feed this to you.

788
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,730
Who is he again?

789
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:15,450
He's the producer for
'2 Days 1 Night.'

790
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,680
Is he my fan?

791
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,460
I don't think so.

792
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,480
I think he's mortal enemies
with CEO Byun.

793
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:29,270
Why?

794
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,840
That I don't know.

795
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,800
Our CEO naturally has a lot
of enemies.

796
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,660
You call yourself writers?

797
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,080
You call yourself a producer?

798
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,160
Release the suspension.

799
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:53,140
I'm going to sleep here if you don't
release the suspension for my kids.

800
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,940
But... if he's mortal
enemies with CEO Byun...

801
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:04,690
why would he give me this?

802
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,170
I don't know.

803
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:13,060
Is he a psycho?

804
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,400
<i>[9 p.m. closing time. KBS parking lot.]</i>

805
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:36,430
Come on, why aren't you
picking up your phone?

806
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:40,000
- Hello?
- Ah, you answered your phone!

807
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:44,850
Sir, I'm not sure if you
got my text message or not.

808
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:49,530
There was a slight accident to your car
while I was going to work this morning.

809
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:53,080
Where are you right now?

810
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,300
<i>Ah yes, I'm almost at the parking lot.</i>

811
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,680
I see.

812
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:03,100
By any chance,
are you a KBS employee?

813
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,450
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

814
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:10,510
My word! Then we're
part of the same family!

815
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:13,440
Which department do you work for?

816
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:17,960
<i>- I work in variety show department.
- The variety show department?</i>

817
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,040
The variety...

818
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,480
No way...

819
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:42,640
You have a nice car.

820
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,350
It's my father's car.

821
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:50,480
Is that so?

822
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,510
Why didn't you respond
to my text message?

823
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:01,750
You told me not to
look at my cell phone.

824
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:05,480
You're right, I did.
Good job.

825
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,270
Ah, there's one more
message I didn't check.

826
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:09,830
Don't do it!

827
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,620
Come here and take a look at this.
I just scratched it slightly.

828
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,180
Okay.

829
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,120
It's not exactly a slight scratch...

830
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:25,280
Don't thing about going easy on
me because I'm you're superior.

831
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,170
I'm not that type of person, okay?

832
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,310
Yes, ma'am.

833
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,730
Okay then, I understand.

834
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,860
You understand?

835
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:45,370
Yes, I can't make a decision on my
own since this is my father's car.

836
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:50,750
I'll give you a call after I
discuss it with my father first.

837
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,350
Of course you should.
You're right.

838
01:00:55,350 --> 01:01:00,430
Yes, well then... good night, ma'am.

839
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:03,860
You go. I'll go whenever I'm ready.

840
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,620
I insist you go first, Senior.

841
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,820
Look at this right here!

842
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:21,660
How am I supposed to get in? Huh?

843
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:25,250
How can I not scratch your car?
Seriously!

844
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:29,380
- Then should I take my car out first?
- Forget it! I'm already inside!

845
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:34,130
Look at this! Look how you parked
your car so closely next to mine!

846
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,630
What about Writer Choi?

847
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:49,490
I called and he's crossing
the Mapo bridge right now.

848
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:52,690
Does he live in that area?
He's always crossing...

849
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,810
Or at least change the name
of the bridge or something.

850
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,100
Eat. Go ahead and eat.

851
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,050
But, why are you buying us hanwoo?

852
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,220
How strange.

853
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:07,220
Is our program getting canned?

854
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,190
No.

855
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:12,600
- What happened to 'Miss A?'
- Forget it. We don't have to do it.

856
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,630
What the heck?
I found the location and everything.

857
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:18,980
Please don't make me work twice.
I'm so freaking tired.

858
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:24,010
- It's true. We're getting canned.
- That's not true!

859
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:35,740
The program is not getting dropped,
but the members need to be replaced.

860
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,850
It's better this way! The ratings
are low and we can't find an answer.

861
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:47,020
We need to gather highlights
for the show next week

862
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:48,980
so let's meet up later.

863
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:52,320
- Do it on your own.
- What do you mean? It's our business.

864
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:55,290
Exactly, it's our business and our show.

865
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:57,970
What about us?
Are we sure we're not getting fired?

866
01:02:57,970 --> 01:02:59,720
That's the important part.

867
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,070
You think this is our
first time having a meeting

868
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,670
without knowing that
we're getting fired?

869
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:06,590
- Who says you guys are getting fired?
- How are we supposed to believe that?

870
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:11,790
You didn't tell us until the very end
when 'Sponge' got canned last time.

871
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:16,120
That's why I took all the
'Sponge' writers with me!

872
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,860
There were 12 'Sponge'
writers back then!

873
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,920
The problem was, there was
no need for all those writers!

874
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,070
That's the type of person I am.

875
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:29,290
The level is different even if
another program got canned like us.

876
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:32,970
The producers get the same pay
whether there is a program or not.

877
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:35,750
This is where you see the difference.

878
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:44,090
I'm sorry, but what's going
to happen with our manuscript?

879
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:46,800
What's the percentage when
the highlight episode goes out?

880
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,170
Wait a minute.

881
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:52,180
Then do we have to find the
materials for the highlight next week?

882
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,540
Is that the problem right now?

883
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:55,970
It is a problem.
That means more work for us.

884
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:58,130
Someone might think that
you're doing all the work here.

885
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:01,880
Producer, I'm sorry but I have
a lecture for grad school today.

886
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,990
If you're done talking...

887
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,210
I'm going to head out firsts.

888
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,320
You saw that?
He always does that and leaves first.

889
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:13,230
I do all the work.

890
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:16,830
Oh my gosh... what are we going to do
about the fashion section next week?

891
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,980
We have to cancel it.

892
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,590
I worked really hard in
convincing them to participate!

893
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:24,530
Seriously, what am I going to say?

894
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:27,940
Just...
Stop crying!

- Can you talk right now?

- I'd like another bottle of soju please!

01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,940
Don't get on my nerves today.

908
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:42,470
Likewise.

909
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,910
Let's pray.

910
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:59,370
What for?
Let's just blow out the candle.

911
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:00,770
What are you talking about?

912
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:04,130
Our Seung Chan got hired to work at
KBS. The best sight-seeing station...

913
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:06,030
It's a public broadcasting
station, father.

914
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:08,470
...in our country.
This is a big deal.

915
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,730
We need to pray all together
and give thanks to the lord.

916
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:15,700
You're right, father.
Congratulation, Seung Chan.

917
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:19,910
But what made you think of
becoming a producer all of a sudden?

918
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:25,370
No kidding. I'm not sure
why I wanted to become one.

919
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:28,960
Seung Chan, you're a 'Music Bank'
producer now, right?

920
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,380
All my friends are so excited!

921
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:34,790
Will we be able to see the
GOT7 members up close now?

922
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:38,000
Goodness, let's hurry up and pray!
The candle is melting!

923
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:39,370
Sure.

924
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,640
Heavenly father...

925
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,490
our Seung Chan got hired to work at
KBS. The best sight-seeing station...

926
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:50,300
It's a public broadcasting
station, father.

927
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,020
In any case, he got
hired to work at KBS.

928
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:56,600
It's a huge honor, Lord!

929
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,320
We pray that he does
your work inside KBS.

930
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:06,560
Also... our eldest son,
Young Chan...

931
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:12,270
He is studying hard for the
upcoming civil servant exam in 2017.

932
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:16,870
Granted, this will be his twelfth year.

933
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:19,710
Please give him the strength
and will to do well this time!

934
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:20,960
Father!

935
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,660
His wife couldn't make it because
of the constant fights they have...

936
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,050
She couldn't come because
she's not feeling well, father.

937
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:28,650
She's got a variety of
excuses, doesn't she?

938
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:32,930
You don't know what it's like.
She got a huge sore.

939
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,720
- It's true, mom.
- Please watch over her health.

940
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:40,020
- And our eldest daughter...
- Just skip over me, please.

941
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:42,370
As she requested,
we'll skip over her.

942
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:50,000
Our son-in-law is the
best urologist in Korea.

943
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,810
For the sake of all men's health in
this country, the gift you blessed him...

944
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:55,000
- Dad!
- Amen.

945
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,150
- We pray all of this in the name of...
- Why do you always forget about me?

946
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:01,390
Why did you give birth to me
if you're going to do this?

947
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,780
- ...our savior, Jesus Christ.
- Amen.

948
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:11,960
Blow out the candle!

949
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,980
All right!

950
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,740
Anyway, I am very happy today.

951
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:27,830
Our son-in-law is a doctor.
Our eldest son is a...

952
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:32,630
will become a judge as soon
as he passes his civil servant exam.

953
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,660
And now our Seung Chan.

954
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:38,880
Our family has so many people
with such prestigious jobs.

955
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,720
Why does it count as prestigious?

956
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:47,080
Producer.

957
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:51,300
Am I wrong?
Producer!

958
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:55,250
Producer!
