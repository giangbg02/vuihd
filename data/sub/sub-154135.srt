1
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:20,334
Who's there?

2
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:21,669
It's Mui.

3
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,795
Ah, Mui...

4
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:25,172
I'll open the door.

5
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:28,718
You can come in.

6
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:47,361
Follow me.

7
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,633
VUIHD.COM HAN HANH GIOI THIEU

8
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:59,206
THE SMELL OF THE GREEN PAPAYA

9
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:21,205
It's little Mui,
our new servant girl.

10
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,797
Poor thing, she walked
a whole day to get here.

11
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:41,392
If To was still alive,
they'd be the same age.

12
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:43,686
Let's not talk about that...

13
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:47,231
Perhaps she's better off
where she is now.

14
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,532
It's the curfew soon
and Trung isn't back yet.

15
00:04:57,992 --> 00:04:59,368
Mother's going to bed.

16
00:04:59,535 --> 00:05:02,371
I'll go up and help her.

17
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:06,852
Ah, Trung...

18
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:09,521
Aren't you in bed yet, father?

19
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:26,742
Go back to sleep.
The mistress said so.

20
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:29,119
I'll wake you to make the fire.

21
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,198
Remember... For this dish,
the oil has to be hot.

22
00:09:51,284 --> 00:09:52,744
Fry the vegetable.

23
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:55,163
Burn it for flavour.

24
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,291
Not too much or it gets all soft.

25
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,794
Then you put it aside.

26
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:04,005
You do the same with the meat.

27
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:07,843
Put that in the water.

28
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:16,351
Fat make the boiled vegetable shine.
It looks nicer.

29
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:20,188
Whether it looks nice or not,
we eat it.

30
00:10:20,397 --> 00:10:22,649
But the masters are different.

31
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,152
Once it's cooked...

32
00:10:37,998 --> 00:10:42,294
Then share it between 2 plates.

33
00:10:44,588 --> 00:10:47,173
Don't forget to keep some for us.

34
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:52,012
There, grandmother
has finished her prayers.

35
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:54,389
Put the vegetables in the water.

36
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,061
Whose mother is she?

37
00:11:00,228 --> 00:11:02,230
The master's. Wash your hands.

38
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:06,985
She lost her husband
just after the master was born.

39
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:10,530
Now, she spends
all her time praying.

40
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:13,533
Quick, put some rice in a big bowl.

41
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:41,561
Is it all ready?

42
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:43,271
Yes, it's ready.

43
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:45,940
Mui, take grandmother's tray.

44
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:48,360
It's alright, I'll take it.

45
00:11:48,902 --> 00:11:50,528
Take this one then.

46
00:12:26,898 --> 00:12:29,275
Father, I'm eating out
with Khuyen.

47
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:32,237
Have your nap as usual.

48
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:34,781
We'll be back for tea.

49
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:36,950
And me, can l?

50
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,993
No, you're too little.

51
00:12:42,122 --> 00:12:45,333
Mui, go and get some more soup.

52
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:52,006
Mother would like you
to keep her company during meals.

53
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:53,508
I'm going up too!

54
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:10,191
Take this upstairs.

55
00:13:37,677 --> 00:13:40,221
Eat up. You're going to be late.

56
00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:43,892
No classes now, grandmother.
It's summer holidays.

57
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:45,768
Ah yes, that's right...

58
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:55,421
We're going, mum.

59
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:58,758
Khuyen and l
will be back for tea.

60
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:01,052
Alright, I'll buy cakes.

61
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:02,011
Good-bye, madam.

62
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:03,888
Good-bye.

63
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,522
Mui, you can eat now.

64
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:15,274
Lam, eat up, dear.

65
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:17,402
Enjoy the meal, mum.

66
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:26,244
Here's your bowl. Eat.

67
00:15:27,537 --> 00:15:30,248
There's no soup left.
What a nuisance.

68
00:15:30,414 --> 00:15:35,670
Upstairs or downstairs,
we spread it out and have none left.

69
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:38,089
After, wash the dishes.

70
00:15:38,756 --> 00:15:41,676
Who was that man with Mr Trung?

71
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:45,763
That's Mr Khuyen,
Mr Trung's friend. Eat up.

72
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:41,535
Tin!

73
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:02,806
Thank you. Good-bye.

74
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:04,850
Good-bye.

75
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:52,105
Mui, wash your hands
and go to buy 10 cakes.

76
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:48,495
In 3 months, you'll go home
to visit your mother.

77
00:23:50,455 --> 00:23:51,790
Thank you, madam.

78
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:49,741
Mui, hurry up. It's almost time
to light the fire.

79
00:26:02,671 --> 00:26:04,589
Little girl...

80
00:26:14,474 --> 00:26:15,433
Your name?

81
00:26:16,393 --> 00:26:17,727
I'm called Mui.

82
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:19,938
I see... You're Mui...

83
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:22,190
My name is Thuan.

84
00:26:22,732 --> 00:26:25,235
It's almost time for prayers.

85
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:26,903
Is grandmother well?

86
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:29,322
Yes, she's well.

87
00:26:31,449 --> 00:26:33,535
That's very good then!

88
00:26:34,285 --> 00:26:35,537
Very good!

89
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:38,164
Thank you, little Mui.
Good-bye...

90
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:40,041
Good-bye, Mr Thuan.

91
00:26:57,767 --> 00:26:58,893
Where are you going?

92
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,437
For some fresh air.

93
00:27:00,603 --> 00:27:03,314
Yes, in this heat,
it's hard to sleep.

94
00:27:04,941 --> 00:27:07,360
Watch out for the curfew.

95
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:27,005
What heat...

96
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:29,883
My God, what heat...

97
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:32,010
It's alright...

98
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:35,096
You can put your things away
tomorrow.

99
00:27:35,764 --> 00:27:38,099
You've worked enough today.

100
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:40,018
Get some rest.

101
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:49,527
Where are your parents?

102
00:27:51,446 --> 00:27:53,323
Do you have brothers or sisters?

103
00:27:53,531 --> 00:27:56,075
My father died three years ago.

104
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:59,204
My mother and my sister
are still in my village.

105
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:02,207
Will you go to see them soon?

106
00:28:02,624 --> 00:28:07,629
The mistress said in three months,
I'll see my mother again.

107
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,924
That's good. The mistress is kind.

108
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,640
Before, who slept on this bed?

109
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:22,519
A servant like you and me.

110
00:28:22,852 --> 00:28:25,230
She went home to get married.

111
00:28:25,396 --> 00:28:28,816
Is the photo on the altar
the grandmother's husband?

112
00:28:29,192 --> 00:28:29,817
Yes.

113
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,446
When he died,
he was still young.

114
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:40,495
Who's the little girl?

115
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:43,748
It's a sad story.

116
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,834
She was the masters' daughter.

117
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:49,462
Her name was To.

118
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:51,673
She died seven years ago.

119
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:56,135
If she was still alive,
you'd be the same age.

120
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,266
How did she die?

121
00:29:06,104 --> 00:29:07,855
A disease.

122
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:10,441
But the master thinks
it's his fault.

123
00:29:10,775 --> 00:29:11,776
Why?

124
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:14,279
Seven years ago,

125
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:19,117
the master left the house
with all the family's money.

126
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:24,580
It was the third time
he'd done that.

127
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:30,336
Before, when he'd spent it all,
he came back.

128
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:34,882
But that time,
he was away longer than usual.

129
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:41,139
But the other times,
when he came back,

130
00:29:41,556 --> 00:29:43,683
she didn't say anything?

131
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:47,061
Nothing. Not a single word.

132
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,689
She was happy.
She cried for joy.

133
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:53,526
What about To then?

134
00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:55,987
The curfew...

135
00:29:59,657 --> 00:30:04,037
There, a little fresh air.
The master must be back by now.

136
00:30:10,418 --> 00:30:12,920
Three weeks after he left,

137
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:15,256
To fell ill.

138
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:19,218
And the day before he returned,
she died.

139
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:22,346
He must have thought she died

140
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:25,641
to atone for the sins
he had committed.

141
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:29,771
That's why he never leaves
the house anymore.

142
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:35,526
Right, let's sleep...

143
00:30:35,693 --> 00:30:38,029
Tomorrow, we have to be up early.

144
00:32:06,284 --> 00:32:08,035
Mother...

145
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:16,043
Mother...

146
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,758
Mother...

147
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,067
Get up. It's time.

148
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:54,206
You're lucky.

149
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:57,335
At your age,
you still have sweet dreams.

150
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:07,595
What did you dream about?

151
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:09,055
I don't know...

152
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:11,390
My God...
I'd like to dream.

153
00:33:11,766 --> 00:33:15,478
But I haven't dreamed for ages.
Let's go and wash.

154
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:38,876
Some mornings,

155
00:33:39,293 --> 00:33:44,757
I wake up with the image
of an old woman in my mind.

156
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:48,594
Perhaps it's because
I dreamed at night.

157
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:52,640
But I don't know if the old woman
is my mother

158
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:54,642
or if she's me.

159
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:05,986
My God, who's in the kitchen
this early?

160
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,918
Mistress, are you already up?

161
00:34:38,686 --> 00:34:39,603
Any rice left?

162
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,356
Just enough for 4 or 5 days.

163
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,318
This is for the market.

164
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:49,280
Make sure there's enough to eat
for a few days.

165
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:15,973
See these earrings?

166
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:20,477
The master has left
with all the money again. My God!

167
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,958
Let's go and clean our teeth,

168
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,668
wash our faces,
hands and feet.

169
00:35:44,835 --> 00:35:46,670
Then comb our hair.

170
00:35:46,837 --> 00:35:49,048
And don't forget the toilet.

171
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:41,892
No, not that one either.

172
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:43,310
I'm sorry...

173
00:36:43,477 --> 00:36:45,187
It's alright. Good-bye.

174
00:36:45,354 --> 00:36:46,647
Good-bye.

175
00:36:58,158 --> 00:36:59,201
What's wrong?

176
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:00,285
I had a fight.

177
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:01,411
Who with?

178
00:37:01,578 --> 00:37:03,038
The children.

179
00:37:03,247 --> 00:37:04,998
Did they hurt you?

180
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,002
Is daddy home?

181
00:37:12,714 --> 00:37:16,510
No. Go and ask Mui
for some clean clothes.

182
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:46,892
When there's not enough,

183
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:50,020
use a lot of salt.
That way,

184
00:38:50,187 --> 00:38:53,106
they'll eat more rice
with the dishes.

185
00:38:54,524 --> 00:38:56,276
For the boiled vegetables.

186
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:10,874
Take this upstairs.

187
00:39:24,805 --> 00:39:26,807
Mother said to start.

188
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:38,193
Ugh! It's too salty!

189
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:40,779
Look.

190
00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:58,004
Eat.

191
00:40:13,228 --> 00:40:14,646
Is it good?

192
00:42:24,192 --> 00:42:26,277
Little Mui... Come here.

193
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:28,613
I want to ask you something.

194
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:44,546
Thank you, Mr Thuan.

195
00:42:44,754 --> 00:42:46,673
Is grandmother well?

196
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:28,506
We're almost out of rice.

197
00:43:29,716 --> 00:43:32,552
We haven't sold a yard of cloth.

198
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,263
Two reels of cotton...

199
00:43:36,222 --> 00:43:38,808
What can we buy with the money
from two reels?

200
00:43:38,975 --> 00:43:40,476
My God...

201
00:44:58,054 --> 00:45:00,973
It's your fault.

202
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,476
If you'd known how to love him,

203
00:45:03,643 --> 00:45:06,312
he wouldn't have left
with other women.

204
00:45:11,567 --> 00:45:13,486
I knew from the start:

205
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,531
my son would be unhappy with you.

206
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,993
You have a husband

207
00:45:22,036 --> 00:45:24,789
and you don't know
how to make him happy.

208
00:47:00,343 --> 00:47:02,261
Alright, that's enough.

209
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:06,933
What about the rest of the papaya?

210
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:08,643
Throw it away.

211
00:47:45,388 --> 00:47:46,097
Enough!

212
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:47,390
Take this up.

213
00:48:07,535 --> 00:48:10,079
It's alright.
You can go and eat.

214
00:48:19,046 --> 00:48:20,464
Enjoy it, mother.

215
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,386
When will daddy be back?

216
00:48:25,553 --> 00:48:27,388
I don't know... Eat.

217
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,478
Why are you crying like that?

218
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,398
Why doesn't daddy come home?

219
00:48:37,606 --> 00:48:38,524
Shut up!

220
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:15,788
Thank you.

221
00:50:15,955 --> 00:50:17,623
My pleasure. Good-bye.

222
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,291
Good-bye.

223
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:41,772
That's it, money for rice.

224
00:50:43,065 --> 00:50:45,401
Go and buy 25 kg of rice.

225
00:51:06,672 --> 00:51:08,590
Hurry. We have to cut the meat.

226
00:51:08,757 --> 00:51:10,634
There... Put that there.

227
00:51:52,885 --> 00:51:54,678
It's very good rice!

228
00:51:57,139 --> 00:51:59,600
- We have a guest tonight.
- Who?

229
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:01,101
Mr Khuyen.

230
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:04,730
Who's Mr Khuyen?

231
00:52:04,897 --> 00:52:06,940
Mr Trung's friend, of course!

232
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:20,120
Can I fry the vegetables
on my own?

233
00:52:21,163 --> 00:52:23,415
Yes, if you want.

234
00:53:22,182 --> 00:53:24,351
Three years after grandfather died,

235
00:53:24,518 --> 00:53:27,187
she still loved her husband

236
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,066
and refused to marry me.

237
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:37,823
Since that day, I've watched her
from a distance.

238
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:43,203
She's moved house several times
and I've always followed her.

239
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:47,499
That's how we were able to meet,
you and l.

240
00:53:55,424 --> 00:53:59,303
Since To's death,
grandmother hasn't been downstairs.

241
00:54:00,012 --> 00:54:05,183
I haven't seen her
for seven years now.

242
00:54:12,774 --> 00:54:14,359
Tell me, little Mui,

243
00:54:14,526 --> 00:54:18,238
couldn't you get her down
into the yard

244
00:54:18,405 --> 00:54:20,157
so that I can see her?

245
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,534
Why don't you go to see her?

246
00:54:22,701 --> 00:54:25,579
If you hid, she wouldn't see you.

247
00:54:26,705 --> 00:54:28,999
No, that's not possible.

248
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:32,586
If she saw me,
it would be terrible.

249
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,257
No, it's not possible.

250
00:54:52,731 --> 00:54:54,107
Go on, go up!

251
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,059
It doesn't matter.

252
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:17,232
My God!

253
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:22,320
The mistress is fond
of these vases.

254
00:56:23,071 --> 00:56:24,906
They're very old antiques.

255
00:56:26,074 --> 00:56:29,703
All my savings
wouldn't be enough to buy one.

256
00:56:30,912 --> 00:56:32,998
You're lucky.

257
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:46,279
Mistress, wake up, quickly!

258
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:08,486
A very valuable piece
but without its twin,

259
00:59:08,653 --> 00:59:11,614
it's worth next to nothing....
It's up to you.

260
00:59:11,865 --> 00:59:13,199
Alright, I accept.

261
01:02:35,234 --> 01:02:36,402
Trung, quick!

262
01:03:00,259 --> 01:03:03,804
10 YEARS LATER

263
01:03:19,153 --> 01:03:19,737
Mui!

264
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:23,032
Hurry!
My mother wants to see you.

265
01:04:42,153 --> 01:04:44,446
For some time now,
business has been slack.

266
01:04:44,822 --> 01:04:47,950
If it goes on like this,
we'll have problems.

267
01:04:51,162 --> 01:04:54,456
The inner yard isn't used
for anything.

268
01:04:54,623 --> 01:04:57,376
We should have
another parrot farm.

269
01:04:57,543 --> 01:04:59,461
Yes... We'll see...

270
01:05:00,921 --> 01:05:03,924
In that case, I'll ask around.

271
01:05:05,593 --> 01:05:07,720
Mother's talking to Mui right now.

272
01:05:08,429 --> 01:05:13,058
Mui won't be that badly off
with your friend Khuyen.

273
01:05:13,392 --> 01:05:17,605
He lives alone
and writes music...

274
01:05:18,105 --> 01:05:20,357
His parents are rich.

275
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:24,069
She'll be better paid
than she is here.

276
01:05:49,219 --> 01:05:52,473
I would have given these to To
if she were alive.

277
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:19,041
Without knowing it,
you've always been a great comfort.

278
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:22,753
Thanks to you,
I feel I've had a daughter.

279
01:06:29,718 --> 01:06:32,721
Lam has left.
He needs somewhere to write.

280
01:06:34,348 --> 01:06:36,850
Now, you're the one who's leaving.

281
01:06:47,695 --> 01:06:50,155
For a long time,

282
01:06:50,364 --> 01:06:53,450
I hoped Lam would take you
as his wife.

283
01:09:42,452 --> 01:09:45,414
My daughter... my little daughter!

284
01:13:35,518 --> 01:13:38,688
Don't eat!
Take me to a restaurant.

285
01:13:46,696 --> 01:13:48,364
Have you got a lot done?

286
01:13:48,531 --> 01:13:50,783
Play me what you've written.

287
01:14:07,383 --> 01:14:09,177
That smells good.

288
01:14:09,928 --> 01:14:12,013
How's your new servant?

289
01:14:13,139 --> 01:14:14,224
Alright.

290
01:14:14,432 --> 01:14:16,976
What does that mean, "alright"?

291
01:14:17,143 --> 01:14:18,895
She works hard...

292
01:14:19,312 --> 01:14:22,315
I'm not asking you that.
But it doesn't matter.

293
01:14:23,483 --> 01:14:25,693
Where's the vase I gave you?

294
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:26,778
It's broken.

295
01:14:26,945 --> 01:14:28,196
Broken?

296
01:14:28,446 --> 01:14:30,990
You mean: "She broke it"!

297
01:14:31,449 --> 01:14:35,578
If I say she did it on purpose,
what would your answer be?

298
01:27:10,081 --> 01:27:14,085
I wonder what percentage
of women in Vietnam

299
01:27:14,252 --> 01:27:17,005
have never touched
their fiance's head.

300
01:27:18,423 --> 01:27:20,342
My mother told me that before

301
01:27:20,508 --> 01:27:22,302
they used to teach girls

302
01:27:22,552 --> 01:27:26,348
that a well-educated woman
should never do it.

303
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:31,561
She also said
that it's almost two weeks

304
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:33,855
since you last came to see us.

305
01:27:34,147 --> 01:27:36,191
Your father's surprised too.

306
01:36:05,324 --> 01:36:08,744
In... my... garden...

307
01:36:09,245 --> 01:36:13,165
there's... a... papaya... tree...

308
01:36:14,792 --> 01:36:16,752
The papaya...

309
01:36:17,086 --> 01:36:19,421
hang... in bunches...

310
01:36:20,381 --> 01:36:21,674
The ripe papaya...

311
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,969
have a pale yellow colour.

312
01:36:25,552 --> 01:36:30,432
The ri... The ripe papaya...

313
01:36:30,724 --> 01:36:34,728
are sweet with a sugary taste.

314
01:36:39,358 --> 01:36:43,862
We've been raising a black dog

315
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:48,283
for three years now.

316
01:36:50,202 --> 01:36:52,287
His body is long.

317
01:36:52,454 --> 01:36:55,165
He has big feet.

318
01:36:59,795 --> 01:37:01,463
His body is long.

319
01:37:02,006 --> 01:37:04,842
He has big feet

320
01:37:05,009 --> 01:37:08,220
and big ears.

321
01:39:32,489 --> 01:39:34,074
I'll start, okay?

322
01:39:37,411 --> 01:39:40,747
The spring water,
nestled in a hole in a rock,

323
01:39:40,956 --> 01:39:43,917
shimmers softly when disturbed.

324
01:39:45,877 --> 01:39:48,046
The vibrations of the ground

325
01:39:48,338 --> 01:39:51,091
have given birth to strong waves

326
01:39:51,258 --> 01:39:54,511
which crash together
in an irregular swell

327
01:39:55,012 --> 01:39:57,931
on the surface,
without cresting.

328
01:39:58,473 --> 01:40:03,311
If there 's a verb
meaning "to move harmoniously"

329
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:06,565
it must be used here.

330
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:11,278
The cherry trees,
gripped in shadows,

331
01:40:11,945 --> 01:40:14,364
spread out and curl up,

332
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:18,201
sway and twist,
