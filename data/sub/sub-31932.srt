1
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,848
Year after year, always trying
to improve, improve.

2
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:44,655
With more experience,
with more objectives, more desires,

3
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,437
proving to my family,
proving to my dad,

4
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,856
that the decisions I took
in the beginning, at the age of 12,

5
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,316
were the best ones.

6
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,420
There are people who love me.
There are people who hate me...

7
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:14,052
who say that I'm arrogant,
that I'm vain or I'm this and that.

8
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,303
That's part of my success.

9
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,473
I was made to be the best.

10
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,269
My dear boy!
Your mother's heart almost exploded.

11
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,399
That's what I wanted to say
to you too, Ronaldo!

12
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:34,567
Oh, my dear boy, you deserved it!

13
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:42,497
The Ballon d'Or is the very best
individual award for any player.

14
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,172
It means you're considered
the best player in the world.

15
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:04,685
To see Messi win the Ballon d'Or
four times in a row

16
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,390
was difficult for me.

17
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:14,569
After he won the second or third
in a row, I said,

18
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,245
"I'm not coming here anymore."

19
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,705
Why do I come here
if I am doing so well for my team?

20
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,326
Why should I come here?

21
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,245
I have to win more Ballons d'Or.

22
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,342
For me, the year gone by
was the best year of my career.

23
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,711
Without any doubt.

24
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:22,683
I try to fight with my
weapons every day, every match,

25
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,684
throughout my career,
to be the best ever.

26
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,183
That second Ballon d'Or

27
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,640
was obviously one of the most
beautiful moments in my life.

28
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,638
But my ambition ends up
always wanting more,

29
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,137
always wanting more.

30
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,109
A new year,
goals to score, trophies to win...

31
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,897
That is the way I live my life.

32
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,296
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

33
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,638
Good morning, Cris.

34
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,274
Come here!

35
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,860
- Give Daddy a kiss!
- Yes. OK.

36
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,896
Silly head.

37
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,423
Let's go.

38
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,885
- Done!
- Give me five! Well done.

39
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,310
The Champions League final
is almost here

40
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,436
and Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid
is searching for a new title.

41
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,686
For the whites, it could be La Decima.

42
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,449
The last time that Real Madrid
won the trophy was in 2002.

43
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,449
...for sure,
Cristiano is doing very well.

44
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:35,375
Clearly, Ronaldo is on top form,
clearly ready to win.

45
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,919
I knew that after Real Madrid hired me,
the pressure would mount.

46
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,759
Real Madrid wanted to win
the Champions League, La Decima,

47
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:49,934
and obviously, to win,
you need to have the best players.

48
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,265
- Whoops!
- I didn't get hurt.

49
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,481
Come.

50
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:56,981
Shall we race to the door?

51
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,774
- Yes.
- Now!

52
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,106
I'm going to win!
I'm going to win!

53
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,860
I won! I won! See?

54
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,633
I was at Manchester for six years.

55
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:26,423
And... I won practically everything
there was to win.

56
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,394
- Impressive, isn't it?
- This is incredible.

57
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,181
- Is there going to be a match or not?
- No.

58
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,775
That was when Real Madrid showed up.

59
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,521
They were willing to pay
a lot of money for me.

60
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,148
I wanted more. I wanted another league.
I wanted a different kind of football,

61
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:47,363
and I wanted a different chapter,
a different challenge in my life.

62
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,869
The stadium was full
to welcome me to the team.

63
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,163
90,000 people at the stadium.

64
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,960
I felt like a star,
like a pop star or a Hollywood star.

65
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:12,302
Today the time has arrived.
Today we welcome to his new home,

66
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:16,558
today we welcome Cristiano Ronaldo.

67
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:33,163
For me, I've achieved
my childhood dream,

68
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,952
which was to play for Real Madrid.

69
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,000
I didn't expect the stadium
to be so full today just to see me.

70
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,675
I can't believe it.

71
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,005
Incredible!

72
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,256
Let's go.

73
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:55,604
One, two, three.

74
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,809
Hala Madrid!

75
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,815
If I had to choose one title,

76
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,859
the Champions League
would surely be the most important.

77
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:17,121
The mythical Decima
was the most wanted trophy in Madrid.

78
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,211
Preparing the shot.
That one might be a goal.

79
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,430
Goal! Goal for Atlético Madrid.

80
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,931
It's clearly in.
Godin scored. Minute 36.

81
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:42,556
Atlético takes the lead
on the scoreboard.

82
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,281
400 million viewers all over the world

83
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:56,492
in more than 200 countries
are watching this match.

84
00:10:56,657 --> 00:11:01,037
And now, Real Madrid
needs to improve and recover

85
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,501
if they want to win La Decima.

86
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,706
And the world's best player,
as well as Real Madrid's,

87
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,837
17 goals in this
year's Champions League...

88
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:05,223
He is a true champion.
Nothing is impossible for him.

89
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,599
Cristiano.

90
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,760
As we did the first time,

91
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:52,178
we're all going to shout together.
One, two, three. "Hala Madrid."

92
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,355
One, two, three...

93
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,769
Hala Madrid!

94
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,221
He's a very big man, isn't he?

95
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,637
Bigger than you.

96
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:34,274
No. Bigger in size,
but Daddy is stronger.

97
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,393
Didn't you know that?

98
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,737
Look. Where's your schoolbag?

99
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,883
Look. Which car is missing?

100
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,210
The Ro...

101
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,956
No, the Rover is outside.
Which car is missing here?

102
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,508
Look at them all. Go on.

103
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,013
Which one is missing?

104
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,218
The Porsche?

105
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,756
Look properly! Look properly!

106
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,226
- The Royce.
- No.

107
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,439
One that is very fast, very fast.

108
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,453
Lamborghini.

109
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,750
- Ah! You didn't know.
- And where is it?

110
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:41,003
It went to change a tire.
A tire blew up.

111
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,138
Go! Go! Go!

112
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,768
I'm going to be a goalkeeper.
OK, Dad?

113
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,686
- No, I don't want that.
- But I do.

114
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,815
A goalkeeper?
Are you joking or what?

115
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,069
Go! Go!

116
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,070
Great defense!

117
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:18,907
Dad, I'm going to teach you
how to shoot a penalty.

118
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,749
To shoot a penalty,
you place the ball here.

119
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,666
But don't go too far away
because otherwise you won't score.

120
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,046
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

121
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:31,802
You have to shoot hard like this
so that you score.

122
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:34,297
- Oh, really?
- Yes, but...

123
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:39,309
- Will you teach me how to do it later?
- Yes. When you're a player...

124
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,234
- What?
- You'll see when we play football.

125
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,774
- Are you going to teach me?
- Yes.

126
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,124
Football has always been my passion.

127
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:02,078
It was always
what I enjoyed doing the most.

128
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:33,111
I was born on the island of Madeira;

129
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:36,277
more specifically in the
neighborhood of Quinta Falcão.

130
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,488
I wanted to be someone in football.

131
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,629
I started playing football at Andorinha.

132
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,214
At the time, my father
was Andorinha's kit man.

133
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,050
I stayed at Andorinha for a couple
of years. Then I went to Nacional.

134
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,216
It was one of the best teams in Madeira.

135
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,604
And then I went to Sporting,

136
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:02,603
leaving Madeira at the age of 12
and going to Lisbon,

137
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,226
a different city, the capital.

138
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,860
I remember leaving home.
My siblings were crying, my mother...

139
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,744
Even my father
was more emotional that day.

140
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:17,372
But they knew that it was
an opportunity I wanted in life.

141
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,914
At Sporting, we were happy
to find a new family.

142
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,752
There were many footballers
with plenty of talent.

143
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,706
But Cristiano had something special.

144
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:31,918
He did different things.

145
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,917
He was never satisfied
with the amount he did.

146
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,839
He always wanted more.

147
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,706
It's the most expensive transfer ever
for a kid his age,

148
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,330
around 15 million euros.

149
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,497
On Manchester's website,
they say 17.3 million.

150
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,786
I don't understand why it's different.

151
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,840
Probably it went to his manager.

152
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:39,094
It's one more victory
for manager Jorge Mendes.

153
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,676
This was Jorge Mendes's big season.

154
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:47,927
Tiago, it's Jorge Mendes
from Gestifute speaking. Good evening.

155
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,348
I'm in Madrid.

156
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:51,602
We have to meet up.

157
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,308
One of these days
we'll go out for lunch.

158
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,607
Jorge Mendes is one of
the most important businessmen

159
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:56,822
in Portuguese football.

160
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:59,742
He represents big names like
Cristiano Ronaldo and José Mourinho.

161
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,740
Jorge Mendes is a super-agent, with
a group of footballers and coaches

162
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:06,326
worth more than 650 million euros.

163
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:09,081
The businessman does business
with all the big names in Europe

164
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:11,214
and represents Mourinho,
Ronaldo, Nani

165
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,501
as well as many other names from
Portuguese and international football.

166
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:18,463
OK, very good. Very good.

167
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:22,344
I met Jorge when I was 16...

168
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:27,394
...and that's when practically
everything began.

169
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:37,769
I felt a great empathy with him
right from the very first moment.

170
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,990
Right to this day, everything Jorge
said would happen has happened.

171
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:02,876
Little Jorge. Dance!

172
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:05,632
Hold on! Come here.

173
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,540
Shall we go home?

174
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:38,754
Let's go home.

175
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,042
Straighten his feet.

176
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,745
- Put him in the back.
- C'mon, son, go in the back.

177
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:45,206
- Open it.
- It's open.

178
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,667
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow, Mum.

179
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,168
I have limpets at home for you.

180
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,839
I'll tell Henrique
to come and get them.

181
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:53,798
- OK, and can he cook them?
- I'll tell him to cook them.

182
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:56,009
You need to explain to him how to do it.

183
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:57,179
Hi, how are you?

184
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,227
- Fine. You?
- Fine.

185
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:08,486
Hi, how are you?
Fine, and you?

186
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,423
Look, Daddy's going to make a drink.
Do you want to try a little bit?

187
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:30,382
- No.
- No? OK. Then I'll do it just for me.

188
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:33,467
Alright?
Or do you not want a little bit?

189
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:36,514
- Just a little bit.
- A little bit for me.

190
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,348
Just a little bit for you to try.

191
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:41,853
Yes. I want the Portug... No...

192
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:44,687
- The Ferrari one?
- Yes, because it's mine.

193
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:46,613
The Ferrari one.

194
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:51,654
See if you like it.

195
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:55,316
That's for you to become very strong!
Look at Daddy's arm, look.

196
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,330
Don't you want to be big like Daddy?

197
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,830
Huh?

198
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,419
Oh, wow!

199
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,632
It's very good.

200
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:12,508
Come on. Finish painting

201
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:15,343
so we can go and play football.
Come on.

202
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,097
It's nearly done.

203
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:20,522
You like it, huh?

204
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,640
Good.

205
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,978
You will be... Whoa!

206
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:31,034
- You're going to be very strong!
- Touch it.

207
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:33,073
That's it. Look at the ball.

208
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:36,698
I tricked you.

209
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,413
That's it.

210
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:39,914
That's it.

211
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:43,658
Now it's bedtime.

212
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:46,083
Come. This way.

213
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,748
To your bed!

214
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:58,853
Give Daddy a kiss.
Sleep well. Give Daddy a hug.

215
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,682
Come on. Let's go.

216
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:07,695
Wait! Let me take out the blankets.

217
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,610
Go.

218
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:15,065
Bye. See you later.

219
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,470
There are twelve days remaining until
Portugal's first game at the World Cup

220
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:41,224
and the main concern
for the Portuguese football team

221
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:44,306
is the most famous acronym
in the world... CR7.

222
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:47,195
Cristiano Ronaldo
has a physical problem.

223
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:50,731
He is limited by injuries
to his thigh and knee.

224
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:55,403
Portugal's going to win the World Cup!

225
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:05,658
Before the Champions League,
with 15 days to go, I was injured.

226
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:09,081
I think it was an accumulation.

227
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,875
Every year I play more than 60 games.

228
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:17,877
Either you stop for two or three months
or you learn to live with the pain

229
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:20,468
and have the psychological strength
to endure it.

230
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:39,032
I can endure the pain because I think
there's something stronger.

231
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:43,624
Maybe if I didn't feel the pain,
maybe I wouldn't be as good as I am.

232
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,009
Give us a smile! Give us a smile!

233
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:04,515
Hello?

234
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,192
Are you joking or what?

235
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:20,955
Yes?

236
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:22,411
- Hello?
- Yes.

237
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:23,701
- Hello.
- Yes, Mum.

238
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:26,914
- You don't have any network, Ronaldo.
- Mum, I'm inside the hotel.

239
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:29,825
You don't want me to go out to
the woods to find a network, do you?

240
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:32,835
OK. OK. Call me when you have signal.

241
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,286
Will do. OK.

242
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:37,588
- Here, Ronaldo. Talk to your father!
- Hello, Daddy!

243
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:40,383
- Send kisses.
- Kisses.

244
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,967
- Say "Go, Portugal!"
- Go, Portugal!

245
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,763
I love you very much.

246
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:48,257
Daddy loves you very much too, son.
Kisses.

247
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,386
- Kisses.
- Bye.

248
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,352
- Bye.
- Bye.

249
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,784
Cristiano, are you
feeling 100 percent now?

250
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:47,705
99.9 percent.

251
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,652
OK. This part's cool.

252
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,864
And...

253
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:50,967
It's Cristiano's favorite color.

254
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,000
I love you, Daddy.

255
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:26,719
When are you coming back?

256
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:31,176
It's now. It's now.

257
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:42,731
Beautiful! A round of applause.
Beautiful!

258
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:52,245
Wherever the national team goes,

259
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:54,236
all the attention
is on Cristiano Ronaldo.

260
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:57,908
Naturally, we're talking
about the best player in the world.

261
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:03,078
Cristiano Ronaldo says he feels
99.9 percent ready for the World Cup.

262
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,340
CR7 left for Campinas in a good mood.

263
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:07,302
Cristiano Ronaldo
shows that he's confident.

264
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:11,052
He's not afraid of using the leg
that's fragile at the moment.

265
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,804
We need to remember
it's patella tendonitis...

266
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:17,849
Gaspar. Gaspar.
Did you bring the ice?

267
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:19,767
Gaspar, I'm talking to you.

268
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:24,653
Why are you asking now we're on the bus
rather than outside?

269
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,398
He forgot about you yesterday
and forgot about me today.

270
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:29,146
Honestly, Gaspar!

271
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:30,738
If it had been Cristiano asking,

272
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:32,703
he'd bring a suitcase full of ice.
A suitcase!

273
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,079
There couldn't be more at stake
for Ronaldo and the Portuguese team.

274
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:44,825
It's going to be essential for Ronaldo
to do well in this World Cup

275
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,670
if he's to retain his Ballon d'Or.

276
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:26,127
Let's go!

277
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:28,253
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

278
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,957
- The ball, the ball... Ball.
- Ball.

279
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:32,841
Let's crush them!

280
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:34,836
Go, go, go, go, go!

281
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:37,967
Let's go!
Let's believe we are a great team.

282
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:39,558
Let's go!

283
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,448
No. He has the telephone number
of the agent.

284
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:56,197
Don't worry! He will take
care of everything.

285
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,873
The match is going to start
in half an hour.

286
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,540
Any other player would not have
played in the World Cup

287
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:53,959
because Cristiano was in
no condition to play a World Cup.

288
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:58,219
Everybody that I spoke to said,

289
00:36:58,302 --> 00:37:00,972
"He's going to put his career at risk."

290
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,966
"He shouldn't play."

291
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:08,807
It could have become a serious problem.

292
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:31,076
It's over. It's over.

293
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:26,849
Look here! It's time to wake up.

294
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:33,477
Frustration starts kicking in
on the pitch.

295
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:35,225
That's what happened.

296
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:37,687
Frustration, being beaten four-nil,

297
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,781
starting the World Cup
in the worst possible way.

298
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,954
It was the worst thing
that could have happened to us.

299
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:55,245
We hadn't met people's expectations,

300
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:57,087
what the Brazilian people
helped us with.

301
00:38:57,212 --> 00:38:58,882
I think we couldn't
give it back to them.

302
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,870
Look at that. Look!

303
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:29,583
He reacted quickly.

304
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,663
Let her go, man! Let her go!

305
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:35,957
Let her go!

306
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:41,263
She was at the hotel waiting
for you yesterday.

307
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,761
- This girl?
- Yes, the same one.

308
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:46,723
- I didn't see her.
- Cristiano, she jumped this fence.

309
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:48,425
Yes, security told me.

310
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:51,135
We'll meet her in a bit.
She's fine physically.

311
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,436
She must be physically fit
to be able to jump this fence.

312
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,060
- And you? Are you physically fit?
- Everything's fine.

313
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:58,268
- Everything? A hundred percent?
- A hundred percent.

314
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:00,188
Thanks, Cristiano Ronaldo.

315
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,820
Don't they want to talk to me as well?

316
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,170
Thank you for everything.

317
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:18,336
Thank you for everything.

318
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,013
I did it!

319
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:24,921
- You did?
- I did.

320
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,970
- What did Cristiano tell you?
- He knows I exist.

321
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:34,315
He asked me to stay calm
and stop crying, to take care.

322
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:38,814
He asked what my name is
and I asked him to follow me on Twitter.

323
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:05,086
- Three times a day...
- Don't exceed three per day.

324
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:07,795
- Can I take one now?
- Yes, you can.

325
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:09,136
- At night?
- Exactly.

326
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:10,471
OK. And tomorrow?

327
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:14,064
If you want to, take it when
you're feeling too anxious like now.

328
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:17,943
I'm going to take one now because
I'm already feeling agitated. OK.

329
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:19,231
- OK?
- OK.

330
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:24,648
- Hello?
- What's up, Maria? How's everything?

331
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:27,903
Have you taken the sedatives?

332
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,820
- Have you taken the sedatives?
- What?

333
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:33,829
Have you taken the sedatives?
Take it easy. It's only a game.

334
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:38,872
Don't be upset, and don't stress out
because it'll go well.

335
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:40,499
It'll go well, God willing.

336
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,924
Take it easy! Don't be upset!
It's only a game...

337
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,305
It's only a football game,
not a matter of life and death.

338
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:48,802
- No one's going to die!
- OK, but... We have to win!

339
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:52,096
OK. But take it easy. No worries.
No worries. No worries.

340
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:55,265
OK, then. A kiss, Mum. Bye. Bye.

341
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:03,688
Carla?

342
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:06,185
My young man is looking beautiful,
isn't he?

343
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:08,318
- Both of them!
- Ha! No, the little one.

344
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:09,735
I'm talking about the little one.

345
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:18,874
And so, tomorrow... Are you ready
to watch the World Cup game?

346
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:21,207
I am, but it's always that thing

347
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:25,963
and it's a match we have to win.

348
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:28,128
- Of course.
- We have to win.

349
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:33,971
And you see, being old,
I get more nervous.

350
00:42:34,096 --> 00:42:36,636
- No, you're not...
- It's true. It's true.

351
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:40,435
I think that when I was younger,
I dealt with it better,

352
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:43,611
whether they won or lost.
But not now. I suffer more now.

353
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,730
But, Dolores, you must be used to
watching your son's matches by now.

354
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:52,569
Yes, but when it comes
to special matches, it's different.

355
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:25,647
This is the second game for Portugal
in the group stage facing the USA.

356
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:29,612
They need to win after their awful
performance against Germany.

357
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:36,445
She lives my world as well.
She lives my joy. She lives my sadness.

358
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:38,987
It's as if she plays football
and not me.

359
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,630
I often say there are times
when my mother looks older

360
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:49,497
because of football.

361
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:52,514
Goal!

362
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,260
Goal!

363
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:10,227
Portugal! Portugal!
Portugal!

364
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:27,039
It's quite complicated for a mother
to watch a son who needs to win.

365
00:44:32,214 --> 00:44:35,684
I get sad.
I get worried.

366
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:38,258
And I suffer a lot.

367
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:48,686
When he gets hit,
it's like they hit me as well.

368
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:51,317
Because I've always
liked football a lot,

369
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:54,191
I wanted to have a son
who'd be a great player.

370
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,120
But I never thought in my life

371
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:02,451
that I'd have a son
who'd be a professional player

372
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:05,623
and be the best in the world.

373
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,710
Go! Go! Go! Goal!

374
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:12,214
Dinis, be quiet!

375
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,127
Go! Go! Go!

376
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:19,551
Now's the time. Score now, Ronaldo!

377
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:20,968
No. I'm going outside.

378
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:22,756
No. No. No.

379
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:36,611
- Pass me my flip-flops.
- But it's not... It's over now!

380
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:38,407
OK. But pass me my flip-flops!

381
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,580
I'm going on my own.
I'm going for a walk.

382
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:46,155
Oh, Ronaldo! Damn it!

383
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:08,395
I risked sending my son to Lisbon
when he was 12 years old

384
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:10,399
which wasn't easy at all.

385
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:18,651
I felt like I was abandoning him,
but it was for a good reason.

386
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:23,279
Because I worked hard
to raise four children.

387
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:26,948
But he was an unwanted child,

388
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:31,124
but that son gave me so much joy.

389
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:37,925
All that I have I owe to that son.

390
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:11,247
However many people turn up, you'll
always be well received, won't you?

391
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:13,123
Is that taxi over there available?

392
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,840
- A photo with you, please?
- The first one, yeah?

393
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,340
We had arrived in Portugal.

394
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:22,053
I didn't say anything to anyone,
got in a taxi and went to the hotel

395
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:26,846
because the next day I wanted to leave.
I wanted to go away on holiday.

396
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:38,649
I didn't even want to go to Portugal.

397
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:41,605
I didn't want to come to Spain.
I wanted to travel.

398
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:45,777
I wanted to go anywhere else
where I wouldn't follow it,

399
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:47,528
because I was sad.

400
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:54,001
I have no doubt that
the World Cup made my injury worse.

401
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:56,884
I feel sad.
I feel that things are not flowing.

402
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:59,462
I don't feel any improvement
in my injury.

403
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:03,473
I could have recovered by now.

404
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:08,012
If I could go back,
I wouldn't have gone to the World Cup.

405
00:49:58,373 --> 00:49:59,543
Are you playing?

406
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:02,376
- It's looking hard, isn't it?
- It's you.

407
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,380
You're well trained.

408
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:08,631
I'm seeing if I'm lucky enough
to be able to pay you the 40 euros.

409
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:10,259
What do you mean?

410
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:12,295
You're almost like
Cristiano "King" Ronaldo.

411
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:15,519
Nah, not yet.
There's still a long way to go.

412
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,641
But it's getting better.

413
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:20,853
So you're pleased! Come on. Sit here.

414
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:23,362
I have to watch it, don't I?

415
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:25,484
It's only us two, right?

416
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:27,149
What's the suit?

417
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,450
- Spades, spades, spades.
- No, no.

418
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:30,571
Which one was it?

419
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:32,697
It's spades! Watch out for the game
or you'll lose.

420
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:16,738
Five, six, seven,

421
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:19,705
eight...

422
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:23,963
- Three...
- Four, five, six, seven.

423
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:28,004
That's it.

424
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:33,130
Ten! One, two,
three, four, five...

425
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:38,104
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

426
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:41,484
That's it. Get off.

427
00:51:41,852 --> 00:51:44,772
Look. It's a draw, the game.
We both won.

428
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,770
We'll do the rest this afternoon,
alright?

429
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:49,819
Give me a snuggle and a kiss.
Give me a hug, my darling.

430
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,371
I consider myself to be
an isolated person.

431
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:01,544
I know what's best for me.

432
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,123
And the best for me is

433
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:07,377
I come home,
completely disconnect from the world,

434
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:11,553
media, television, football

435
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:16,683
because I know that the next day I'll be
pulled back into that world again.

436
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:19,969
I like to be quiet.
I like not feeling pressure

437
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,060
after training, after the games.

438
00:52:22,184 --> 00:52:24,984
I like to enter my world.
I am at home.

439
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:27,187
I'm with the people I like.
I'm with my son.

440
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:29,234
And I am at peace with myself.

441
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:49,587
I have everything.
There's nothing that I don't have.

442
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:51,921
But people are always waiting
for me to make a mistake,

443
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:56,047
to accuse me, to criticize me.
It's difficult. It's very difficult.

444
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:26,786
Wait. Wait. I can see him.
I can see him.

445
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:33,341
I think I will always be observed
in a different way.

446
00:53:33,463 --> 00:53:37,053
But that's part of what I have
achieved in the world of football.

447
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:41,137
Maybe when I end my career,
things will become quieter.

448
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:55,611
What name have you chosen
for this baby?

449
00:53:55,736 --> 00:53:57,236
Hugo Tomas.

450
00:53:57,821 --> 00:54:00,241
Are you aware that you are
obliged to educate him in the faith

451
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:03,115
so this child can keep
God's commandments?

452
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:04,243
Yes.

453
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:09,789
And you, the godparents, are you willing
to help his parents in this task?

454
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:10,917
Yes.

455
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:14,963
Hugo Tomas, the Christian community
receives you with great joy.

456
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:17,798
I do the Cross on you as a sign
of Christ the Savior.

457
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:28,774
The celebration has concluded.

458
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:33,266
Congratulations on the new Christian
in your home.

459
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:37,607
And one last thing, later, outside,
if you don't mind,

460
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:40,776
take a selfie with me. OK?

461
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:50,539
Have a picture together. Go.

462
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:30,246
Cristiano Ronaldo has lost his father.

463
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:33,632
Dinis Aveiro leaves our world
at the age of 53.

464
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,670
His condition deteriorated
in the month of July.

465
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:41,585
Cristiano Ronaldo booked an air
ambulance to take his dad to London,

466
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:45,347
but his kidneys and liver
couldn't hold out any longer.

467
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,990
Ronaldo's father drank a lot.

468
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:10,412
He had cirrhosis
and he died due to drinking.

469
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:16,382
Ronaldo did everything
he could to save his father,

470
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,670
but he couldn't.

471
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:29,894
I think it was because he joined
the Portuguese Colonial War in Angola

472
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:36,395
and he returned angry
because of the war.

473
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,860
And when he came back,
he felt very angry

474
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:45,034
and although he never mistreated
his children, he never did,

475
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:47,235
I became his victim.

476
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:57,996
My father, he was very funny
when he was drunk.

477
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:02,341
He used to tell a lot of stories.
He used to sing.

478
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:04,224
He was funny.

479
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:11,893
He was drunk nearly every day.

480
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:13,595
And when that happens,

481
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:18,555
it's not easy to have a conversation
to get to know my father a bit more.

482
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:20,979
I'm not ashamed to say it.

483
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:25,238
I didn't really get to know
my father for real, from the heart,

484
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:27,862
to open up and tell him things.

485
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,120
I never had those kinds of
conversations with him.

486
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:38,044
If you ask me why my father
became an alcoholic, I don't know.

487
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,840
Maybe he was frustrated with life.

488
00:57:42,963 --> 00:57:45,223
I don't know.
I don't know and I don't care.

489
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:49,219
I feel some frustration

490
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:53,854
because obviously I wanted
a different father,

491
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:57,774
a dad who could be more present
to see my achievements.

492
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:01,903
That's what frustrates me the most.

493
00:58:02,024 --> 00:58:05,864
The fact that he can't see
all my successes as a player,

494
00:58:05,986 --> 00:58:09,026
as a person, as a father as well.

495
00:58:09,907 --> 00:58:15,247
But I think that I managed
to handle things in his absence.

496
00:58:15,996 --> 00:58:17,996
Give me five!

497
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:20,668
Ah! You tricked me.

498
00:58:32,513 --> 00:58:34,763
Cristiano Ronaldo
has become the father of a boy.

499
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:40,060
The news was announced by the footballer
himself on Facebook and Twitter.

500
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:43,267
The Portuguese international
doesn't reveal the mother's name

501
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:46,648
and says he'll have
sole custody of the child.

502
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:53,618
Ronaldo announced the birth of his son
first in English and then in Portuguese

503
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:55,412
so there were no remaining doubts.

504
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:58,286
But as for the mother's identity,
not a word.

505
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:01,793
Irina Shayk is Cristiano Ronaldo's
current girlfriend,

506
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:06,837
but everything suggests that the son
is from a previous relationship.

507
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:11,551
For two hours the reporters waited
for a glimpse of the idol and his son.

508
00:59:11,677 --> 00:59:14,547
It was only CR7, who left his house

509
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:17,968
to say that he was happy
but upset at the same time.

510
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:21,641
I'm happy, but you disappoint me.
You're always here disturbing me.

511
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:24,730
Always walking around the house.
And you make me upset by doing this.

512
00:59:24,857 --> 00:59:28,567
Regarding the mystery surrounding
little CR's mother, not a single word.

513
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:30,742
Are you going to announce
anything else about the child?

514
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:31,993
What do you mean?

515
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:34,414
The big question we all have basically
is if the child was...

516
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:38,955
That's pointless. That's pointless.
It's pointless to ask because...

517
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:40,659
Was it done at a clinic?

518
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:43,669
Don't go there. It's pointless.
I've said everything I have to say.

519
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:46,042
I'd like you to give me some privacy.

520
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:50,091
You can color it here, here, here...

521
00:59:50,215 --> 00:59:51,755
- OK?
- OK.

522
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,600
I always had this dream
of having a son

523
00:59:58,682 --> 01:00:00,892
to be my successor.

524
01:00:03,061 --> 01:00:05,401
I wanted to be a young father,
and I was.

525
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:07,356
I was 25.

526
01:00:07,482 --> 01:00:10,782
Because I wanted to be able
to follow him

527
01:00:10,986 --> 01:00:13,946
during his development
as a person, as a man.

528
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:15,622
That was always a dream of mine.

529
01:00:22,456 --> 01:00:26,126
Obviously, Cristiano has been
a big influence on me.

530
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:31,338
I have learnt to be calmer,
more cautious.

531
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:33,805
I have learnt a lot
about being a father.

532
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:41,636
People speculate that it was
with this girl or the other,

533
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:45,225
or a surrogate mother.
I've never told anyone and never will.

534
01:00:45,354 --> 01:00:47,154
I think I should keep that to myself.

535
01:00:47,272 --> 01:00:51,942
And later, when Cristiano is grown up,
then I will talk to him

536
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:56,949
and tell him what I did, what I felt,
everything that went through my mind.

537
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:01,833
Some kids never get to know
their parents,

538
01:01:01,954 --> 01:01:05,924
neither father nor mother.
Having a father is good enough.

539
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:14,724
I don't care what other people say.
It doesn't bother me.

540
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:20,682
I always thought, and still think,
that he will understand me.

541
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:30,573
I can't believe it!

542
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:33,608
I can't believe it!

543
01:01:33,986 --> 01:01:37,196
He doesn't have anybody
apart from his father and me,

544
01:01:37,322 --> 01:01:41,032
and so he does spend
a lot of time with me.

545
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:43,695
Now how is he going to score?

546
01:01:45,998 --> 01:01:49,538
Pass! Pass it forward!

547
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,420
I'm not bothered
about who the mother is.

548
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:54,715
I just want to give my grandson love

549
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,640
and educate him as Ronaldo asked me to,

550
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:01,763
as I did for him.

551
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:04,059
He reminds me of Ronaldo
when he was a child

552
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:07,273
and I see little Cristiano
just like his dad.

553
01:02:07,603 --> 01:02:09,193
Goal!

554
01:02:09,897 --> 01:02:11,227
Daddy!

555
01:02:12,858 --> 01:02:14,528
Great!

556
01:02:15,152 --> 01:02:17,782
Look, it was Daddy!

557
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:49,309
Cristiano shoots and... Goal!

558
01:02:49,686 --> 01:02:52,186
The winner of the Ballon d'Or!

559
01:02:52,314 --> 01:02:57,994
- The best player of last season!
- Goal! Goal! Goal!

560
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:12,581
Goal! Goal! Goal!

561
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:32,899
Cristiano scores
his 11th goal of the season.

562
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:54,214
The goal record of Cristiano Ronaldo
is astonishing,

563
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:56,544
even surpassing the total
number of goals

564
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,470
scored by some teams
in the Spanish league.

565
01:04:00,591 --> 01:04:02,591
Hat trick for Cristiano Ronaldo.

566
01:04:02,718 --> 01:04:06,848
It's his 13th goal in the league
in only seven matches.

567
01:04:23,322 --> 01:04:26,912
You have to show yourself
that you really are good.

568
01:04:28,202 --> 01:04:29,952
That's always my priority,

569
01:04:30,078 --> 01:04:32,958
to prove to myself
that I still have the ability,

570
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:38,294
that I can do better things,
wanting to win more than other people,

571
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,420
demonstrating
that I'm better than others.

572
01:05:12,246 --> 01:05:14,906
Your son says that you're going
to score two goals.

573
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,120
One for me and one for him.

574
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:19,000
- Yes, yes. A dream.
- Yes. He said that to me.

575
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:20,501
We'll win five-nil.

576
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:22,383
God willing.

577
01:05:22,923 --> 01:05:26,013
Yes. Goodbye.
Speak soon. Kisses. Speak soon.

578
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:28,138
Bye. Bye. Bye.

579
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:30,719
Bye. Bye. Bye.

580
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:43,108
The Ballon d'Or is obvious.

581
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:45,705
I don't need to ask your opinion.

582
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:47,951
But you'll be there on January 12th.

583
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,831
Are you expecting an emotional reaction
from Cristiano Ronaldo if he wins?

584
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:54,292
I can only tell you I don't know
what is going to happen.

585
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:55,833
The only thing I can tell you

586
01:05:55,956 --> 01:05:59,036
is that there has never been
a year like this one.

587
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:02,798
The difference between first and second
is so big that there is no doubt.

588
01:06:02,963 --> 01:06:04,553
And if Cristiano doesn't win,

589
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:07,683
it would be best that
they stopped doing this event,

590
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:12,641
that it didn't appear any longer
in the history of this trophy.

591
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:14,974
Because the difference, truly,
is so great,

592
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,440
because it's not even worth
anyone asking,

593
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:19,021
"Will it be A, B or C?"

594
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:21,476
The difference is so great
that in the history of this trophy,

595
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:27,317
there has never been so great
a difference as this year, 2014.

596
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:30,526
The difference was an abyss,
and so there can only be one winner.

597
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:35,045
Well, that's OK. I'll organize it.

598
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:37,001
You're going crazy!

599
01:06:37,331 --> 01:06:40,501
No, no. I was talking to someone here.

600
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:44,086
With the father of a footballer
who's going to be phenomenal.

601
01:06:44,213 --> 01:06:45,593
OK.

602
01:06:46,048 --> 01:06:49,718
It's an extra motivation
that he prods me all the time

603
01:06:49,843 --> 01:06:53,473
and always roots for me,
believing that I can always do better,

604
01:06:53,597 --> 01:06:55,637
believing that I can always
be even better.

605
01:06:55,766 --> 01:07:00,556
His desire to show the world
that I'm the best ever

606
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:02,397
is a reason for happiness.

607
01:07:02,856 --> 01:07:06,026
He became an older brother.
He became a father.

608
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:10,454
Jorge is another member of my family.

609
01:07:25,504 --> 01:07:28,474
I'm the brother
of the best footballer in the world

610
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:32,390
and so I don't need anyone
to notice me. I don't need that.

611
01:07:34,429 --> 01:07:37,719
My father taught me
it's better to keep silent.

612
01:07:40,477 --> 01:07:43,937
My father used to say,
"A silent person wins more."

613
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:56,372
If I applied myself and trained,
I'm sure I'd also be a footballer.

614
01:07:56,493 --> 01:07:57,583
I'm absolutely sure of it.

615
01:07:58,954 --> 01:08:00,834
I had some talent.

616
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:05,458
Ronaldo could have gone down
the wrong path.

617
01:08:05,586 --> 01:08:08,836
But he took the right path, and I was
happy that he chose that path,

618
01:08:08,964 --> 01:08:10,554
working to become a footballer.

619
01:08:17,598 --> 01:08:20,978
I've had issues with addiction.

620
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,560
I was already drinking
at the age of 20.

621
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:30,360
I worked for a long time with my father.
I worked in construction.

622
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:34,156
30 years ago,
everyone working in construction

623
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:36,991
would drink alcohol. Everyone.

624
01:08:37,451 --> 01:08:42,211
I asked for help.
Then I had a relapse again.

625
01:08:43,707 --> 01:08:47,167
Then, on my own,
I told myself it was enough

626
01:08:47,294 --> 01:08:50,804
if I wanted to have a decent life
and if I didn't want to die young.

627
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:55,046
I stopped, and until today,
my life's healthy. Thank God.

628
01:08:57,012 --> 01:09:00,522
From the day I pulled myself together,
Ronaldo has always helped me.

629
01:09:03,227 --> 01:09:06,437
We have to get away from people
who are always in trouble.

630
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:13,489
Addictions, drugs and alcohol
won't get us anywhere.

631
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:29,458
He knows that he made mistakes.

632
01:09:29,586 --> 01:09:34,466
He made some mistakes in life,
and he's the first to admit that

633
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,891
and these are moments
he managed to overcome.

634
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:41,560
And so for me today, he's someone
that I trust with my projects.

635
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:46,692
He owns my museum.
He's my right arm in many things.

636
01:09:46,812 --> 01:09:49,522
He's someone I will trust
for the rest of my days

637
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:50,938
and he's a businessman.

638
01:09:54,736 --> 01:09:59,446
Like they say, if we won't help
our family, who will we help?

639
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:03,078
He might have gone through a bad period,

640
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:07,253
but God gave him a new start
which was having a perfect family.

641
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:13,460
Thank you, brother, for all you've done.

642
01:10:13,839 --> 01:10:18,429
Thank you, brother, for all you've done.

643
01:11:01,762 --> 01:11:04,512
I can't. I can't. I can't now.

644
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,930
OK. OK.
Look! Do you know something?

645
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,480
Do you have any idea
what day it is today?

646
01:11:10,604 --> 01:11:13,824
Forget that! Call me after the game!
Call me after the game!

647
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:40,883
Hello.

648
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:43,679
Will you give your godfather a kiss?

649
01:11:44,763 --> 01:11:46,013
Who will win?

650
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:47,890
- Who will win?
- Madrid!

651
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:50,689
- Madrid!
- Real Madrid.

652
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:52,811
How many goals will Daddy score?

653
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:55,647
Two? No, Four! Two is not enough.

654
01:11:55,774 --> 01:11:57,614
Four, four, four.

655
01:11:58,026 --> 01:11:59,686
At least four.

656
01:12:21,717 --> 01:12:23,337
I'm afraid of the other guy.

657
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:26,468
He's the only one
who can win the Ballon d'Or. Huh?

658
01:12:26,597 --> 01:12:31,347
- The other guy could destroy everything.
- No. No, he won't.

659
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:48,353
I think rivalry
is always created by the press.

660
01:13:53,725 --> 01:13:57,725
The relationship with Messi,
in the last year, was much better.

661
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:02,323
We've spoken more about ourselves.

662
01:14:02,442 --> 01:14:03,862
He asked me about my injury,

663
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:07,066
how my old injury was
from the World Cup,

664
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:09,697
asking about the family...

665
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:17,536
I looked at him not as a rival
but as a person

666
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:20,878
who makes me a better player
and I make him a better player.

667
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:29,048
We are always busting our balls
to see who's better.

668
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:06,382
Penalty! Penalty! Penalty! Penalty!

669
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:08,007
Penalty!

670
01:15:11,845 --> 01:15:14,255
Cristiano Ronaldo is at the ball.

671
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:18,849
This is a spot
he hardly ever misses from.

672
01:15:20,812 --> 01:15:24,272
Cristiano shoots and goal!

673
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,440
An equalizer in El Clásico.

674
01:15:27,819 --> 01:15:29,199
16 goals for Cristiano in La Liga,

675
01:15:29,321 --> 01:15:31,241
and the fifth penalty
for the Portuguese player.

676
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:33,325
They appear to be
on the best form ever.

677
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,580
Ronaldo and Real Madrid
are clearly imposing themselves

678
01:15:36,703 --> 01:15:38,833
in this match against Barcelona.

679
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:45,671
Goal, Cristiano.

680
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:51,302
The three points stay with Madrid
at the Bernabéu.

681
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:55,846
Real Madrid and the fans celebrate
this very important victory

682
01:15:55,973 --> 01:15:59,983
for Carlo Ancelotti's team.
A three-one win.

683
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:03,442
The local team, Real Madrid,
was undoubtedly better than Barcelona.

684
01:16:03,564 --> 01:16:05,864
It's a huge party here
at the Santiago Bernabéu.

685
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:26,752
The people I trust the most
and that I feel the most...

686
01:16:26,879 --> 01:16:28,049
Esteem. Esteem.

687
01:16:28,172 --> 01:16:30,972
- Esteem and friendship for.
- And feel friendship for.

688
01:16:31,091 --> 01:16:33,471
If you want to talk, you can do it!

689
01:16:37,097 --> 01:16:40,477
But in fact the people I trust
the most are present here.

690
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:44,646
I want that to be clear. It's true.
I'm saying it from the heart.

691
01:16:45,606 --> 01:16:46,896
I hope we can do this again

692
01:16:47,024 --> 01:16:50,034
because it'll mean we're happy
and things are...

693
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:52,822
- And alive.
- Alive and doing well. Thank you, all.

694
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:54,486
Well done!

695
01:16:55,532 --> 01:16:58,332
- To the best!
- Health!

696
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:00,082
The best thing to do
is put all your money

697
01:17:00,204 --> 01:17:01,664
in that vault you have in your room.

698
01:17:01,788 --> 01:17:04,618
It doesn't fit.
Do you think it fits in there?

699
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:08,041
Big Jorge!
We started from nothing.

700
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:12,010
Jorge, we started from nothing
and now...

701
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:18,430
Big Jorge didn't have anything either.
He went around selling videotapes and...

702
01:17:18,555 --> 01:17:20,805
- And playing music.
- And look at the man now.

703
01:17:20,933 --> 01:17:22,273
Straw hats.

704
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:26,102
- And now he's always wearing Rolex.
- This one's a fake.

705
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:29,518
I come from a good family.
They were just dirt poor.

706
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:31,325
They were.

707
01:17:31,443 --> 01:17:33,493
- Old times!
- Great episodes.

708
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:35,164
Great episodes lived with big Jorge.

709
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:43,831
Now for the best one, Jorge.

710
01:17:44,331 --> 01:17:47,131
You need a drink.

711
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:53,965
As for my friend Hugo,

712
01:17:54,091 --> 01:17:57,591
I still remember the past and things
that don't need to be talked about now.

713
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:02,429
I'm proud of him because he
overcame his adversities.

714
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:05,598
To think back then,
that we'd be here today,

715
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:11,477
and you've got businesses in your hands

716
01:18:11,608 --> 01:18:17,948
and ambitions for a bright future
for you and your family.

717
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:20,083
I'll give you a kiss.

718
01:18:24,204 --> 01:18:29,384
Now, after the mother I had,
you're the mother I'd like to have had.

719
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:39,052
This is... This is...

720
01:18:39,178 --> 01:18:40,718
My special son.

721
01:18:41,138 --> 01:18:43,388
I don't need many words,
because he knows it.

722
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:47,975
I live obsessed about him every day.
But he deserves it.

723
01:18:48,103 --> 01:18:51,153
It's not because...
You could not be everything you are.

724
01:18:51,273 --> 01:18:54,403
But I'll tell you something,
I fight for you every day.

725
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:57,396
I feel very proud to be able
to fight for you every day.

726
01:18:57,529 --> 01:18:59,359
I want to do it with conviction.
You deserve it.

727
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:02,239
You're a lot more
than I could ever do for you!

728
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:03,827
It's nothing.

729
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:07,502
In terms of your value,
I could do twice what I do.

730
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:10,753
It'll never be enough
to be up to your level,

731
01:19:10,834 --> 01:19:14,884
your quality,
both human and sporting qualities.

732
01:19:15,005 --> 01:19:16,165
You're a monster!

733
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:18,798
This is the best in the world,
the best footballer in the world.

734
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:21,296
The best sportsman, I tell you.
And I mean it.

735
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:23,298
There's really no doubt about it.

736
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:27,270
He's the best in the world and everyone
will recognize that for sure.

737
01:19:27,392 --> 01:19:30,312
All the world. No one will be
indifferent to that.

738
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:32,267
He's the best sportsman
in the world ever

739
01:19:32,397 --> 01:19:36,277
and I'm proud to be standing
next to a guy like this

740
01:19:36,401 --> 01:19:39,241
because it's a truly impressive thing!

741
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:45,325
Oscar! Give him an Oscar!

742
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:49,712
If I didn't know you,
I'd ask you for an autograph.

743
01:19:54,378 --> 01:19:57,168
- Jorge...
- You lost your glass somewhere.

744
01:19:57,297 --> 01:19:59,257
A toast to Jorge!

745
01:20:05,806 --> 01:20:07,306
Jorge is the best.

746
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:09,182
Jorge. Top!

747
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:10,689
Top, top, top.

748
01:20:44,052 --> 01:20:47,352
The Ballon d'Or is a day
when your heart beats faster.

749
01:20:48,098 --> 01:20:51,388
You sweat more. You're more anxious,

750
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:55,193
more tired, both psychologically
and physically.

751
01:20:55,314 --> 01:20:56,904
It's a very intense day.

752
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:02,859
My mother, my siblings,
I feel they were also very nervous.

753
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:05,738
Even Jorge Mendes.
Everyone who was with me.

754
01:21:16,752 --> 01:21:18,002
It stays for life.

755
01:21:18,128 --> 01:21:22,548
People who like me,
the family, the fans,

756
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:24,884
they never forget about it

757
01:21:24,968 --> 01:21:28,138
because it's the climax
of a year's work,

758
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:31,683
of a career that started
when I was 11 years old,

759
01:21:31,808 --> 01:21:35,228
playing football always
with the goal of being the best,

760
01:21:35,687 --> 01:21:38,267
winning trophies, winning titles,

761
01:21:38,398 --> 01:21:42,028
having a good life, making money...

762
01:21:42,152 --> 01:21:45,742
Everything. It's all part
of the same package.

763
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:52,910
It's a card inside an envelope
that can change so much.

764
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:58,457
You're a chicken.

765
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:07,641
My son accompanying his dad
and seeing with his own eyes

766
01:22:07,761 --> 01:22:09,971
the glories of his father,
that's unique.

767
01:22:10,931 --> 01:22:14,641
He's already proud of me.
He shows off my trophies.

768
01:22:15,435 --> 01:22:17,845
That makes me an even happier person.

769
01:22:18,772 --> 01:22:21,112
You're a clown!

770
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:23,784
I'm the same as you.

771
01:22:23,944 --> 01:22:25,654
Let me see if your hands are cold.

772
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:27,783
You're cold.

773
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:31,371
I just had a shower
to wash bad luck away from my body.

774
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:34,043
- To wash what?
- Bad luck.

775
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:37,415
Come here. Take a photo
with me and Ronaldo, please.

776
01:22:41,879 --> 01:22:43,839
You need to be very well behaved

777
01:22:43,964 --> 01:22:47,264
otherwise Daddy won't buy you
anything tomorrow.

778
01:22:47,384 --> 01:22:49,514
Otherwise Daddy won't win.

779
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:51,846
I always do. And will you cry?

780
01:22:51,972 --> 01:22:54,312
I will.
I'm always the first one to cry.

781
01:22:57,895 --> 01:23:01,275
- Why are they shouting?
- Because of the players.

782
01:23:01,398 --> 01:23:03,268
What did they call you
when you went outside?

783
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,530
Who's that guy there?
Who's that guy over there?

784
01:23:05,652 --> 01:23:08,492
The one wearing a suit. Who is it?

785
01:23:11,033 --> 01:23:12,203
Go on. Go on.

786
01:23:16,288 --> 01:23:18,118
Are you OK? Yes?

787
01:23:18,624 --> 01:23:20,634
High-five him.

788
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:23,038
What's up? Are you well?

789
01:23:25,172 --> 01:23:26,672
Are you being shy now?

790
01:23:26,798 --> 01:23:28,048
He's shy now.

791
01:23:29,092 --> 01:23:31,802
Who's that?
He's being shy now.

792
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:35,769
- Look at that shyness!
- He can't believe it's him!

793
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:38,143
- It's Messi.
- Give Daddy a kiss.

794
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:40,188
A kiss? Why?

795
01:23:42,606 --> 01:23:44,686
I'm always giving you kisses.

796
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:47,066
He can't believe it.

797
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:49,904
And why do you like playing football?

798
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:02,711
Bye. Bye.

799
01:24:04,837 --> 01:24:05,957
Done.

800
01:24:47,296 --> 01:24:50,756
You'll see that I'll end up
without any teeth.

801
01:24:57,973 --> 01:24:59,183
Come here.

802
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:12,951
Nearly there, nearly there...

803
01:25:13,113 --> 01:25:14,573
Wait!

804
01:25:22,289 --> 01:25:23,619
You see?

805
01:25:23,749 --> 01:25:25,419
Everything's possible.

806
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:28,752
"And he was crazy for her!"

807
01:25:28,879 --> 01:25:31,049
Done!

808
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:43,639
You're the best, man! The best!

809
01:26:27,354 --> 01:26:30,654
He was a child
that I wanted to abort.

810
01:26:30,774 --> 01:26:33,784
God didn't want that to happen,
and I was blessed because of that,

811
01:26:33,902 --> 01:26:35,572
and God did not punish me.

812
01:26:37,656 --> 01:26:41,486
Sometimes Ronaldo makes fun of me

813
01:26:41,618 --> 01:26:43,748
and says,
"You didn't want me to be born."

814
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:48,631
"But now you see
that I'm here helping all of you."

815
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:54,130
And, well, sometimes,
we have a laugh about that.

816
01:26:57,467 --> 01:27:00,097
It's like a family relationship.

817
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:02,930
And after that, I'm passionate
about his game,

818
01:27:03,056 --> 01:27:06,806
about the way he plays,
the way he dedicates himself.

819
01:27:07,811 --> 01:27:10,271
I see Cristiano like a son,

820
01:27:10,397 --> 01:27:12,267
like a real son.

821
01:27:20,365 --> 01:27:23,275
I've lived life's sorrows,

822
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:27,620
so did Ronaldo,
and life took a turn.

823
01:27:28,165 --> 01:27:30,255
It's been a journey.

824
01:27:30,334 --> 01:27:33,594
Life can really turn around.
The world is round.

825
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,880
He's our protector
and he always helped us

826
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:40,298
and everything we have today
we owe to him.

827
01:28:04,618 --> 01:28:06,198
He's going through
a great moment of fame.

828
01:28:06,328 --> 01:28:10,498
He is, these days.
I'm enjoying it greatly.

829
01:28:10,624 --> 01:28:13,634
- How does a father feel?
- He's really standing out.

830
01:28:13,752 --> 01:28:18,592
The father likes it.
It's always good. I feel emotional.
