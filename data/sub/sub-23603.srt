Tập 1

1
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:16,810
<i>Let's go together. Let's go together. 
I want to go with you, too.</i>

2
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,110
Don't do it.

3
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,460
I don't like it.

4
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,530
Don't go

5
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,320
<i>I'm not. I'm not. I'm not a monster.</i>

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,620
<i>- Go! Leave! 
- Get out of here!</i>

7
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,200
<i>I'm not. I'm not a monster.</i>

8
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,630
Stop it!

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,420
I mean... What are you all looking at?

10
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,920
Student, what's wrong?

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,400
I'm the only one who's becoming the strange one!

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,540
Did I do anything to you?

13
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,180
You did it to me! Me!

14
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,490
<i>What's wrong with this woman?</i>

15
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,100
This person is a rapist.

16
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,280
That guy is a rapist. Did you get that?

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,950
What are they saying?

18
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,130
Where are you going?!

19
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,910
Ah, why are you being like this? Seriously!

20
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,890
<i>What's with you...</i>

21
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,810
Get that guy!

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,670
You... go to my school, right?

23
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,530
<i>I smell blood.</i>

24
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,650
Are you okay?

25
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,050
<i>Blood! It's sweet blood.</i>

26
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,000
I asked if you were okay. Can you stand by yourself?

27
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,610
<i>This blood...</i>

28
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,830
<i> I want to eat it.</i>

29
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:41,810
<i>This is Seomu Station.</i> 
<i>Your exit is to the right.</i>

30
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,220
<i>If you plan to go in the direction of the bus terminal</i>

31
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,350
<i>please get off at this station.</i> 
Hey!

32
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,240
What's with her?

33
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,140
If you get off, you're going to be late for school.

34
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:17,830
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Vampire Lovers @ Viki </i>

35
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,470
<i>Why... am I attracted to a human's blood?</i>

36
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,770
<i>Come to your senses, Baek Ma Ri.</i>

37
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,790
<i>You're... not a monster.</i>

38
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,150
<i>Episode 1</i>

39
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,360
<i>I will definitely... graduate from this school.</i>

40
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,660
<i>Baek Ma Ri</i>

41
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,010
<i>I will no longer be chased.</i>

42
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,370
<i>This time, it will absolutely not be discovered,</i>

43
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,290
<i>that I'm a vampire.</i>

44
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,120
Now, Jung Jae Min, come up and solve it.

45
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,840
Yes.

46
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,420
<i>Yes?</i>

47
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,950
<i>- She's the new transfer student. 
- Ah, yes.</i>

48
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,770
<i>Now, new transfer student? Baek Ma Ri. Right, well...</i>

49
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,950
Being tardy on the first day has the most impact, right?

50
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:56,340
<i>You can introduce yourself later. For now, go sit at that empty desk over there.</i>

51
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,030
What are you doing? Are you not going to solve it? 
 Yes?

52
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,570
Solve it. 
- Ah, yes.

53
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,470
See? I told you you'd be late.

54
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,530
Ma Ri? I'm Soo Ri. Welcome, welcome! You have more guts than you look.

55
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,100
The class is almost over.

56
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,960
Yeah...

57
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,070
It's a vampire! 
- Awesome!

58
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,700
Hey, look at this. You...

59
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,410
This is our school uniform! 
- <i>Oh? You're right.</i>

60
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,250
It's true! 
- Wait...

61
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:45,020
Isn't that her? The transfer student? 
- You're right. - I think you're right.

62
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,550
Is... this really you?

63
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,300
Woah, awesome, awesome! Guys! It is Ma Ri! It really is her!

64
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,170
<i>Awesome! Wow! 
- Hey! Hey!-- It's really her!</i>

65
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,190
Really? 
- Then, you were sitting right next to a vampire?

66
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,830
Yeah.

67
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,670
Wow, seriously awesome. 
- Were the vampire's

68
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,510
teeth really sharp? And his eyes red?

69
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,060
Hey! Is he a rabbit, for his eyes to be red?

70
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,810
He looks exactly like a human at first glance!

71
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,040
If his eyes are red, then how can he ride the subway?

72
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,430
<i>Don't look at me like that.</i>

73
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,910
Just wondering... didn't he feel cold?

74
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,630
Like a zombie corpse?

75
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,250
Zombies are in the movies but vampires are right now.

76
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,290
<i>Stop it.</i>

77
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,440
A vampire touching me?

78
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,050
<i>Stop it, please.</i>

79
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,980
That vampire... didn't do anything to you?

80
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,570
I heard you sat next to him.

81
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,380
You must've been so scared.

82
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,990
It's probably because of this.

83
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,570
What is that?

84
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,710
Vampires are scared of crosses.

85
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,270
Ah, right, right.

86
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,440
<i>I hate this... these kinds of lies.</i>

87
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,060
Relax, just say you experienced a fright.

88
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,980
It's not like you'd run into another vampire again, right?

89
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,340
<i>But... I'm a... vampire</i>

90
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,390
<i>Their beginning is not recorded.</i>

91
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,500
<i>They've been by our side for a long time,</i>

92
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,580
<i>[Between the living and the dead]</i>

93
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,600
<i>surviving through human blood.</i>

94
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,330
<i>Not a person, but something that appeared like a person. A ghost.</i>

95
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,330
<i>Like this, they were rumored to exist in past generations</i>

96
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,030
<i>and were revealed as reality in the 17th century.</i>

97
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:09,000
<i>Killings were done secretly for generations and</i>

98
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,370
<i>just before extinction, Joseon Royalty and the vampire clans</i>

99
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,520
<i>made a peace treaty.</i>

100
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,610
It would have been better if they had gone extinct.

101
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,510
Those vampires.

102
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,400
Excuse me, Teacher.

103
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,470
How can we believe you? That peace treaty.

104
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,640
Where is the guarantee that we will be protected?

105
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,450
Because of the strict system that was maintained,

106
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,130
and as you all know the main focus on the peace treaty

107
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,640
was to not consume human blood. In return,

108
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,970
the vampires lives were protected.

109
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,820
Humans and vampires found a way to coexist.

110
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,770
Coexistence?

111
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,990
Show me. Go and you will know.

112
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,400
Why? In our society, coexistence exists. Humans and vampires, together.

113
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,330
Mr. PD <i>(Producing Director)</i>.

114
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,040
Someday, if your neighbor was a vampire,

115
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,100
and you came to know, what would you do?

116
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,100
It's dangerous! You said they consume alternative blood, 
but it's still blood nonetheless...

117
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,780
It's scary! Let's assume, what if some vampire suddenly turned back and sucked someone's blood?

118
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,400
It would be scary. It would be uneasy.

119
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,220
We would have to alert the authorities 
that a vampire lives next door,

120
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,290
and every time the vampires would run away.

121
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,370
This is, from the point of view of humans, coexistence, isn't it?

122
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,880
Do you even understand what the meaning of coexistence is?

123
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,810
Why do we have to coexist?

124
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,950
There are only a few of them anyway. 
Can't we just get rid of them?

125
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,100
Vampires are merely humans with different eating habits.

126
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,540
We should think that every living organism,

127
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,850
everyone has the right to live.

128
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,090
Humans are ridiculous! PD,

129
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,110
have you asked the polar bears?

130
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,320
Do they think that the humans on this 
earth are coexisting with them, too?

131
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,080
Why are they endangered?

132
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,580
They would go nuts!

133
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,960
But to humans, we vampires are just...

134
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,820
an existence no better off than polar bears.

135
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,600
They look just like humans.

136
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,560
Is there no way to distinguish them?

137
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,040
Wait, that means there could be one in our classroom.

138
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,820
Vampire.

139
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,320
Vampire! I will drink all of your blood!

140
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
It's tasty!

141
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,180
Ah, stop it!

142
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,430
What's wrong?

143
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,770
I was just kidding.

144
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,600
Watch closely. This is the type of creature we are.

145
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,050
What are you doing?

146
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,790
Can you see this?

147
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,030
Vampires are more superior than humans.

148
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,660
We lost most of our powers not consuming human blood.

149
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,620
We killed our instincts and gave up our powers. What about humans?

150
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,440
What the hell did you do for that coexistence?!

151
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,260
Vampire's unique characteristics...

152
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,640
There's definitely something, but they aren't showing it to us

153
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:49,220
to protect their small population and their human rights.

154
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,280
Aren't... human rights something that only humans should have?

155
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,960
Vampires...

156
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,240
aren't humans.

157
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,150
Ah...

158
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,410
<i> "Aren't humans." </i>

159
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,200
What is this?

160
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,320
Oh, I don't like it. It smells.

161
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,580
It's a vampire special menu.

162
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,410
They say vampires don't like garlic.

163
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,290
Right, right.

173
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,460

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,700
Let's go!

177
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,670
Hi, Ah Ra. This is good, right? 
- Yeah...

178
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,490
Is it not? Eat this.

179
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,650

180

182
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660

184
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,000
Ah, such a waste, this blood.

185
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,070
You should have held it and shot! Are you some kind of goat?

186
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,370
Why are you ripping out the grass and eating it?! Oh, so frustrating. Seriously.

187
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,110
Hey! This...this... Can you not do that?

188
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,880
Even I can do that! Me!

189
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,940
As expected, when it's soccer, it's Chi-Maek.

Really? Indeed my wife is capable.

194
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,800
I found a cafe needing a barista.

195
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,380
What's this smell?

196
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,980
Oh? What smell?

197
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,640
I don't smell anything.

198
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,100
I smell something like chicken.

199
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,780
Did you try to play human again?

200
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,460
Why spend money on something you can't eat?

201
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,260
Is the money rotting?

202
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,240
No...

203
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,340
It's just that next door sells fried chicken.

204
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:48,060
And we got along well.

205
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,400
Don't even dream of playing soccer.

206

<i>You couldn't control your strength so we had to move before you were caught.</i>

207
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,310
Now, don't even think about moving.

208
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:11,300
Let's settle down until Ma Ri graduates, please!

209
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,680
How do humans eat something

210
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,180
so rotten like this?

211
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,610
It'd be a different story if it was chicken blood.

212
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,880
Honey, even if I can't eat it,

213
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,120
if I eat chicken, my heart starts beating.

214
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,000

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,660
Ah, you're eating so well. So well.

220
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,050
This batch is tasty.

221
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,850
Right? It's tasty, right?

222
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,220
Ah! It's good.

223
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:31,460
Anyway, it's Ma Ri's first day, I don't know if she's doing well.

224
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,920
She has to adjust well to her new school.

225
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,600
Our daughter is probably having lunch right now.

226
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:14,410
<i>Like a normal human, without sticking out,</i>

227

228
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:24,430
<i>Baek Ma Ri, you can do well.</i>

229
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,760
Rock-paper-scissors! Rock-paper-scissors! Rock-paper-scissors!

230
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,800
Ha! Dad won. Open your mouth.

231
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,580
It's not the time to change his back teeth, right?

232
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,700
They're still small so there is still a long way.

233
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,520
Honey, did you see the news?

234
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,960
Either way, all the cafes talk about vampires.

235
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,800
I guess it'll take time for it to settle.

236
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,620
Every time this happens, and they persecute us,

237
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,400
it make my heart shiver, Honey.

238
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,060
Aigoo... But this happens every year... Aigoo.

239
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:23,160
He made a mistake hundreds of times. What is sexual harassment? Sexual harassment!

240
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,740
This time, too, the VCS (Vampire Control System) will most probably issue the "staking" punishment.

241
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,880
Staking?

247

<i>We are still unsure what "staking" is,</i>

248
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,700
<i>but it is understood as a strict punishment for vampires.</i>

249

<i>There has been no prior victim of sexual harassment by a vampire.</i>

Jae Min, this performance is sold out.

So what?

254
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,300
Huh? I heard you were in a band in middle school.

255
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,680
They say guitarists dream about seeing this one play.

256
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,180
I want to see it, but I won't go.

257
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,740
Why?

258
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,980
It's just... I quit guitar. If I see it, I'll want to do it again.

259
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,400
You can do it again. You can continue playing then.

260
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,540
Our school doesn't have a band anymore.

261
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,380
Band?

262

♫ <i>Although you may not be interested</i> ♫

319
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,990
Can you hear me now? 
- Who are you?

320
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:26,710
You... don't know me?

321
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,770
Do you know me?

322
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:34,550
I can't not know. We're in the same class.

323
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,780
<i> I found out for the first time </i>

324

<i> that someone who can stop my time. </i>

325
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,530
<i> Do you know that? </i>

326
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,740
<i>The world that surrounded me</i>

327
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,290
<i>disappeared for a moment.</i>

328
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,740
<i> In the paused time, </i>

329
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,160
<i>the only sensation,</i>

330
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,630
<i>the feeling of only breathing,</i>

331
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:17,040
<i>that... was you.</i>

332
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,660
If you have nothing to say, can you move? 
- Wait.

333
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,770
<i> The smell of blood! His is sweet, too.</i>

334
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,770
<i> Ah, what do I do? What's wrong with me lately?</i>

335
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,720
What are you doing?

336
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:38,190
Take some showers. 
- Hey...

337
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,890
I shower every day! Do you have mysophobia? 
<i>(*Fear of germs.)</i>

338
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:44,240
Why is someone who has mysophobia attacking only me?

339
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,200
Can you speak so I can understand?

340
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,710
I don't want to.

341
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,850
Let's do it the hard way. I don't want to do it easy.

342
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:01,400
You need to apologize to me.

343
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,440
For what? 
- Look at this.

344
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,460
How can I get a sincere apology from someone who can't even remember?

345
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,230
So, you're saying that you don't know who I am?

346
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,530
You just said, "We're in the same class."

347
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,210
But a girl who transferred 2 days ago

348
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,940
is expected to know everyone's face in class?

349
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,510
I am Jung Jae Min.

350
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,760
So what?

351
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:31,620
Hey! How much do you not have to care to not know your class president?

352
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,520
And do you think we only saw each other inside the classroom?

353
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,400
Remember, and make sure to apologize to me.

354
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,680
I'm asking you what I did wrong?

355
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,090
Why ask? I told you I was going the hard way. Remember it yourself.

356
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,130
So I'm going to follow you around until you sincerely apologize.

357
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,030
Do you like music?

358
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,870
No. 
- Then why are you always carrying this around?

359
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:07,320
Ear muffs. I don't like noisy things.

360
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,210
Do you know how to play the guitar, by chance?

361
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,990
No.

362
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,400
Then,

363
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,920
what about this?

364
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,880
It looks like guitar chords.

365
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,630
Our son is so handsome.

366
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,870
He grew up so well, right?

367
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,450
Doesn't he look like an European actor?

368
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:07,000
That's a little too much..

369
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,780
I think they're really cool.

370
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,030
Jae Min does look like that.

371
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,960
You miss him, right?

372
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,370

374
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,900
Please send this well.

375
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,920
I want to give it to him directly, but he won't meet me.

376
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,610
I'll try to convince him.

377
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:52,150
I feel bad that he even gave up on music, which he loves,

378
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,260
all because of me.

379
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,150
Because he hates me,

380
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,310
he even hates his talent.

381
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:23,960
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Vampire Lovers @ Viki </i>

383
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:43,100

384
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,060
"Jung Jae Min, what?"

385

Baek Ma Ri...

386
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:18,090
Is this face

387
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,980
that common of a face?

388
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,420
Who are you?

389
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:34,670
How can you see this face and...

390
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,420
forget it?

391
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,000

Thank you.

402
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:02,660
Try it. The coffee here is famous, but their orange juice is great too.

403
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,360
Like at home when you squeeze the orange-

404
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,380
I didn't come here to say that I won't.

405
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,660
Then?

406
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,600
I came here to say I <i>definitely</i> won't.

407
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,800
Oh...

408
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,840
Therefore,

409
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,960
stop sending me 20 messages like a stalker, to a student,

410
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,560
Teacher.

411
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,220
At least while drinking the juice-

412
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,060
It's a favor...

413
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:41,160
Don't say things like how the coffee tastes and how the juice tastes, it gives me goosebumps.

414
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,200
Is it fun to act like that, while we know each other already?

415
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,660
I heard you were basically a legend. The best guitarist in your middle school band.

416
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,360
What kind of legend.

417
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,840
Let's do it! A school band.

418
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:01,940
Why hide it? I heard you played since you were 5.

419
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,920
Whenever other kids played with toys, you played your guitar.

420
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,340
I heard you held it while sleeping?

421
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,660
Stop it.

422
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Jae Min, let's be honest.

423
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,480
You're dying to play now, right? It was your dream. I heard it from your mom.

424
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,500
I said enough!

425
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,260
Why are you messing with my dream?!

426
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,120
Just be my mom's husband.

427
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,020
Don't try to

428
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,200
cosplay as my new dad.

429
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,140
I don't have those thoughts. It's just regretful.

430
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,280
Just because you rebel, should I throw you away? Your dream?

431
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,640
Ask yourself,

432
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,340
if you have the right

433
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,580
to say something like that.

434
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:08,220
Don't act like you know me at school.

435
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,660
It would be nice if you could transfer to a different school next semester.

436
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,740
I came here to say that.

437

It was your birthday a couple days ago.

438
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,280
Accept this.

439
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,220
I can accept it

440
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,360
and throw it away, right?
